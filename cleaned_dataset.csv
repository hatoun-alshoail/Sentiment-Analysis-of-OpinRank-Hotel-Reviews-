this was our first trip to new york so i was unsure where to stay location is really important to us and since we had tickets to a concert at madison square gardens across the road we decided on the affinia manhattan with macys only a couple of blocks away and great local eating we were thrilled with our choice the room was large and the added bonus of a kitchenette made this a great place to stay i cant thank the concierge staff enough for their help with tickets sightseeing etc their local knowledge and friendly service helped make our trip yes the bathrooms were small but perfectly adequate and yes it was noisy but we were in the middle of manhattan i thought it added to the experience,Positive
stayed nights at the affinia manhatten in a studio suite and everything was greattwo very comfortable double beds which was enough for three adults housekeeping was excellent and we had no problems with anything we needed a quick phone call to reception and it was sorted we had a room on the th floor so the noise was not too bad only the fire engines on our street but they were not too often if you need a good diner in the area the best one we went to was at the back entrance of madison squre gardens called the stage door deli we had our thanksgiven dinner there and it was delicious thanks again to amy for all the help with our booking will definitely recommend the affinia to our family and friends cant wait to go back,Positive
we stayed at the affinia from the rd to the th novemberi had done a great deal of research on hotels to find one that i thought would be a good betonce we got our room sorted we did change times as first one had no tub and the second was overlooking an internal courtyard and foot away from somebody elses window we finally got a room on the th floor overlooking maddison square gardens it was a great room could see all the way down to times square and had the buzz of city lifethe concierge at the hotel were fantastic maureen and ashley were great when asked for advice and help regarding transportation etc and where to buy ugg boots thanks ashley and another lady sorry cant remember her name who recommended an amazing thai restaurant in chelsea about a minute walk from the hotel the food at spice was so good we went twice had amazing cocktails wait staff were amazing and you never once felt rushed if you have a chance to go gothe bar next door niles is great reasonably priced great cocktails and great service including great banter from the bar staffwe loved new york and cant wait to come back for our honeymoon although i think we would stay somewhere else inthe city not because we didnt love the affinia but because we would like to see something different,Positive
we loved this hotel the room was great we had a room with a patio on the th floor my husband is a smoker so this worked out well because the kids and i hate the smoke the room was very spacious bathroom very small but very clean bedroom was great living room and kitchen were very spacious only problem was the noise i am still hearing sirens and taxi horns i would recommend this hotel to families because of the kitchen and seperate bedroom we really enjoyed our first trip to new york city,Positive
my teenage daughter and i stayed one night we were on the th floor facing madison square garden and the train stationthe one negative about this hotel is the street noise you can hear it loud and clear ask for a room in the back away from the street and on a high floor the room was clean and yes the bathroom was small but i was not planning on speding a lot of time in there tv was an old model but it worked and we were not in the city to look at tv staff was friendly and helpful they do have a locked room for your suitacases if your room is not ready room was clean and somewaht outdated in decor for less than a night for queen beds and a kitchenette it was well worth the money,Positive
i was slightly nervous about staying at the affinia manhattan because id read some poor reviews on tripadvisor however my partner and i thought it was excellent and would recommend it to anyone especially if it was their first visit to new york the hotel is in a fab location just over the road from penn station so if youre flying in to newark you can just hop on a train at the airport straight to penn the reception staff were extremely helpful and gave us a choice of rooms explaining that some would be noisy our room was at the back and on the th floor it was large with a fully functioning kitchen and bathroom with tub and shower we slept with the windows open so could hear some traffic noise but it didnt disturb us we had a fab trip and looking forward to returning again next year,Positive
excellent location blocks to macys blocks to times square and across from penn station we had a studio room on the rd floor room was huge full kichen decent sized full bathroom and king sized bed the only downfall was the noise being so close to street level the night time noise was awful ask for a highlevel roomthe kitchen was handy for breakfast there is a deli just downstairs to pick up some bits good hotel and great value for the money,Positive
was recommended this hotel by friends and although at time of booking were able to find cheaper accomodation have no regrets whatsoever hotel in ideal location across from madison square garden a ten min walk from time square and empire state bus from across the road brings you to battery city park for ferries to statue of liberty and ellis island room spacious kitchenette with full size fridge huge bed pillow menu although ensuite a bit on small side all spotlessly clean reception staff doormen conceirge all excellent nothing too much bother gave helpful info on restaurants and visiting tourist sites well be back,Positive
my husband and i have just return from our night stay at the affinia manhatten hotel on what was our rd visit to nyc the location of the hotel is fantastic and many of the citys top attractions such as the empire state building times square fifth avenue etc are within very easy reach in fact if you are planning to visit maddison square garden this hotel is right across the street i hadnt read any reviews of the hotel prior to booking as i booked through a travel agent and we had previously stayed at the affinia shelbourne on our last visit a year ago we were not disapointed at all im surprised at some of the critical reviews about this hotel yes the bathrooms are a bit cosy but having stayed at the shelbourne hotel the bathrooms are tiny there to as they are in may big city hotels yes the decor in the rooms and the hallways is looking a little dated but the beds are comfy and have lovely quality bedding and the showers are hot and powerful and way better than my shower at home the best bit was having the kitchen area including a fridge so we always had chilled water or whatever we needed for the amount of time you spend in your room in this city it was more than acceptable to us and we are regular travellers i will say that i agree with the comments about the noise however we had a room on the third floor and the traffic and the fire crews heading out could be rather loud they didnt disturb me but i am not a light sleeperoverall i would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a great location friendly and helpful staff and good value for your money we would certainly stay here again,Positive
the affinia is classy and clean and the staff provided us with great service my boyfriend and i stayed at the affinia manhattan for two nights in march with our golden retrieverwe werent interested in spending a ton of money or staying at an unnecessarily fancy place it was just a night for a studio suite the one we got was huge but it was also plain and basic we had a super comfortable kingsized bed small kitchen and highspeed connectionthere was plenty of room for our dog barney to walk around we wanted to make sure we picked a place where barney could have a good time the location is great right next to madison square garden its also a minute walk to a dog parkrestaurants and bars nearby after all it is new york we had some drinks at the bar in the hotel they have some good fruity specialty drinks for about its a nice place to get drinks before or after a night out,Positive
we booked this trip through a discounter name begins with price and ends with line at a decent rate i called right after booking and spoke with someone to make sure that we would have beds in our room as we were traveling with our child he said no problem funny thing when we checked in the very quotnicequot attendant said that in order to have two beds we would need to upgrade the room and that she would quotgive usquot a discount from to i mentioned that i had called and that quotstevequot hadnt mentioned an upgrade charge she said that he wouldnt know about thatfind that hard to believe the room was spacious and thats about the only positive thing that i could say about the hotel when we arrived to our room the service man was still in it with his equipment one container appeared to be fumigation spray he quickly left for nyc the rooms are spacious we were on the st floor unfortunately given the old windows not high enough to be away from city noisewe had two full size beds and a kitchenette the beds are hard and uncomfortable though the sheets were nice our floor underneath the bed sported a left behind sock and some really nasty looking debris the bathroom was small but clean with just a little mildew in the tub grout carpets are worn as are the walls and furniture tvs are old school there is a clock radio and a hair dryer iron and ironing board are also provided the draperies were dingy around the edges be warned they do not supply coffee in the room but there is a coffee maker toaster microwave stove and full size fridge along with a sink they also provide some basics such as plates glasses and some pots and pans no dish soap but there was a dish towelbell staff was helpful when you could find them and the lobby is pretty much the only nicely appointed area from what i saw of the building ill not be going back to this hotel,Positive
this lobby was not bad but the minute we hit our hallway i knew we were in big trouble think of something out of the shining the bathroom was so incredibly small furniture old and chipped carpet was so old and had lumps and bumps all in it and the overall musty smell was the topper oh and our window was stuck open couldnt close it do not waste your time or money no matter what good deal you are getting ive stayed in nicer econolodge we ran to the waldorf which is not that great anymore but was way better than here,Positive
stayed four nights in october in excellent queen bed studio on the corner looking towards penn station and down to times square booked via travelrepublic six weeks ahead and got a great dealroom was clean and bright huge fridge in well resourced kitchen there is a shop for groceries two doors down restaurants aplenty nearby we breakfasted mostly at andrews coffee shop three blocks away great diner with all the classic favourites with a mixed crowdover the road is harringtons bar and restaurant went for lunch to watch a football proper footballsoccer match from london fulham v roma got a metro pass with loaded on and it lasted four days walked to grand central empire state book ahead times square lion king was amazing and macys two blocks awaya big shout to the women at the concierge desk in the lobby incredibly helpful and knowledgable you can print off your boarding pass there tooi would definitely go there again especially if you can get the deal,Positive
hotel was an excellent find i stayed with my wife and another couple two rooms and the affinia manhattan was in an excellent location as penn station is so central and the hotel is just a short walk to macys times square etc as other reviews state for this hotel the rooms sizes are excellent we had a queen sized bed with lots of floor space and an good kitchen bathroom too obviously the lobby is very decadent and the staff were great only gripe would be the hotel bar we used it once but the air con was too cold and the girls didnt want to go back but really when we take our kids to nyc well stay at this hotel,Positive
its location half a block down from penn station is ideal and a short walk to macys and the empire state if its your first visit to ny you could not do much better the lirr along with the airttrain from jfk to jamaica arrive across the road even with a heavy load it is very acccessible it was my first time staying in the affinia had no complaints at all was on the ninth floor can be noisy for light sleepers when the fire station horns start blaring you become immune to them after the first night nearly the room was a fine size plenty of towels and the bathroom gels were always restocked which was nice checkin and checkin out were stress free and all the staff were nothing but polite even tom the doorman took our bags to the traffic lights outside and could not have been nicer across the road is penn station and by subway it makes all of ny easy to get to would i stay here again yes ideal for a short stay in the big apple,Positive
just back from a week in the affinia manhattan for the second time as last time the thing that stood out was the wonderful service and the onebedroom suite we arrived from london worn out and were immediately made very welcome by nino diaz at the front desk who also sorted out a change of room as i wanted to be on a higher floor nino and the information desk staff looked after us so well throughout our stay our room was kept immaculate and extra pillows and minor repairs sorted out very quicklyi love the fact that the bones of this hotel are old and the room queen bedroom living room with sofa bed two bathrooms kitchen was just like living in a flat very very comfortable bed and my son didnt complain about the sofa bedthe decor is fine but this is not a cutting edge hotel the bathrooms are small but clean and freshly decorated the kitchen is fully equipped including a filter coffee machinethe location is fantastic with several subway lines either just across the road or a couple of blocks away and the easy trip to jfk from penn station is great noise can be a problem with the fire station so close by but as my son said its what new york sounds like personally i love the fact that you can open the windowsa minor gripe is no free wireless internet but you can use a computer for free at the information desk to check in your flight and print a boarding passthis hotel is great as long as you take it for what it is not flashy but very comfortable and convenient,Positive
the location of this hotel is amazing we walked everywhere taking the airtrain and lirr from jfk for only per person instead of a cab ride and being able to get off at penn station and walk across the street to the hotel was pricelessour room looked nothing like what is advertised on the hotel website if any of the rooms and hallways have been renovated they certainly werent on the th floor where we stayed the room was outdated carpet was stained drapes and shades were dirty the bed was the only redeeming quality the bathroom was so small you could barely turn around the kitchen had no plates or silverwarethe staff is adequate dont expect anything special from themif youre looking for a great convenient location and a clean bed to sleep in this is the place if youre looking for a typical boutique hotel that will create a memorable experience of your stay in nyc with outstanding rooms services and amenities this is definitely not the place,Positive
stayed in a bedroom suite nd highest floor view of empire state from bedroom great location just a few blocks from times square walked everywhere would definately stay again,Positive
we booked this hotel after reading about it on tripadvisor and never having been to new york before we did not know what to expect it turned out to be a gem great location right in the middle of all the action as said before after a long trip the bed was heaven foot wide and really comfortable the room was very big and we even had the kitchen area which came with a cooker fridge microwave and utensiles we were at the back and think it was a better room than being near the front as the noise is hour food is no problem in ny and macys is a couple of blocks away also penn station across the road will take you direct to newark airport for approx saving a fortune on taxiswe recommend this hotel to anyone on a first trip a great experience,Positive
i booked this hotel for relatives visiting from europe and i had really mixed feelings about the hotel rooms one was a room with two beds beautiful decorations at the walls new furniture and a lot of space the other was a room similar to a studio kitchenette with flatware bedroom living room with a sofa bed but not particularly nice the sofa bed and the carpets looked old and outdated the bedroom was pretty dark and cold the hotel midtown location is extremely convenient for transportation lirr subway shopping macys and to visit manhattan the rooms are clean and the service outstanding,Positive
this certainly isnt a bad hotel but it just suffers in comparison to other affinia propertiesthe affinia was offering specials when we booked and the manhattan was less than the dumont where weve stayed before and loved it since the mahhattan was kittycorner from penn station and we were flying into newark its easy to get to penn station from newark we thought wed try the manhattan the dumont is so much better that we will pay the extra next time we actually had what the staff told us was one of the best roomsa remodeled studio it was very comfortable and it was very quiet surprisinglyit was in the back of the hotel but there was a fire station below and i expected noise but luckily no our room had a nice view of the empire state building the staff made such a big deal about how nice our room was that id hate to stay in one of the regular guest roomsmy assumption is that they arent very nice at all hotel pros location near penn station madison square garden empire state buildingactually we easily walked all over down to chelsea for the high line even to greenwich village union square and the flatiron district i like that its in the southern part of midtown to be closer to interesting neighborhoods like those midtown to me is boring the staff was very nice as was our room flat screen tv good bed and pillows quiet room with sitting areahotel cons the hotel is a bit worn all over they charge for internet access which seems a relic of the pasteven cheap chain motels give you free wifi or offer a computer for free room cons there were closets but only hangerswe had to call down for more hangerswe had a coffeemaker but upon arising realized there was no coffeewe had to call down for that too they told us that was their policy it would have been nice to know that the night before there was an office nook but the bathroom was tinyi wonder why they didnt try to give more space to the bathroom nrather than put in an office my husband couldnt even shower without the curtain sticking to him the shower was so small the bathroom only had one towel hook even though there were room for morethe bagel maven on the corner across the street and south is a great place for breakfast or lunchthey do hot breakfasts like eggs with either table service downstairs or you can order at the counter and take it upstairs great bagels and bagel sandwiches too,Positive
this hotel is in a great location and very central to everything the rooms are much larger than most ive seen in downtown new york but they are very tired looking rooms were clean and staff friendly and helpful with reservations etcthe walls are pretty thin and i could hear the whole conversation of the woman next to us also the fire and police sirens were going off all night so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper we had two issues that caused us grief one was the key not working on the second and third day when we would get back from shopping and need to hurry for dinnertheatre on one occasion i called guest services for ice to be delivered to my room and after hours plus a second phone call i went down to the front desk and got it myself the internet fee is day for convenient location this is a good spot but my husband and i will probably not go back until they renovate it,Positive
first time to nyc from australia and this was recommended to me fantastic hotel and great location right in the heart of it all short stroll to times sqaure macys penn station right across the road to starbucks and borders will be staying there again the next time im in nyc staff were tremendous and very helpful considering i was on my own and first timer gave me great tips on where to go around the city my first time nyc experience came with staying at this great hotel very clean and the bed was very comfy sort of an art deco feel and i absolutely love this theme home away from home,Positive
hotel affinia manhatten was in a great location right across the street from the penn station the room was fairly large with double beds pull out sofa bed and a full kitchen with stove and fridge the restroom was pretty small but the large room kitchen and closet space over come that minor defect friendly fast service for a great budget rate i would definably be returning,Positive
fabulous central location helpful polite friendly and knowledgeable staff the room was spacious clean and comfortable double beds the handy kitchenette and hour store next door were a real bonus we are returning next year and will stay here again amazing value for money,Positive
this was our first visit to new york we were very nervous as to what to expect we need not have worried we stayed for days we had a studio room the bathroom was small but perfectly adequate the addition of the kitchenette was helpful although not essential as everything you could possible need food and drink wise was within easy walking distance the bed was incredible comfortabe and we had a great view from the th floor the location of the hotel is certainly one of its best selling points times square is only mins away not too close for the noise th and th avenue minutes away maceys on your doorstep if i had to make any critism of this hotel the corridors to the rooms are looking a bit worn and dowdy they could do with a bit of brightening upi must add a great thanks to maureen on the conciege desk she recommended the blue fin restaurant to us for our th wedding anniversary dinner she also booked it for us she made sure we had a great table and that the staff new of our special occasion it turned out to be a wonderful night would we stay there again absolutely,Positive
just returned from a great stay at the affinia manhatton great location right opposite penn station and madison square gardens concert venue so transport throughout the city is fab check in was quick very friendly and we were given what we asked for if you want a view of the city expect noise take earplugs because it would be a shame to ask for a quiet room as you will be put at the back nothing nicer than sitting in a chair last thing at night and looking out over the ny scene wonderfull ask for a high floor corner refurbished room then you will have a duel oulook over sides the room was spacious and newly decorated the bathroom unfortunatley was not but useable for a short stay a beaufull s building was very happy with our stay would recommend and would stay there again,Positive
the staff was friendly the rooms were beautiful and very clean and the location cannot be beat but the traffic was so loud that we thought the windows must be open they werent im a pretty deep sleeper so it didnt bother me too much but my mom was kept up a lot of the night because of the noise we were on a high floor too i imagine it would have been worse on the lower floorsall in all id recommend it and stay there again particularly because we were able to find a superb deal online but id bring earplugs,Positive
i stayed at the affinia manhattan at the end of may it was a birthday trip that i had decided to go solo on at the last minute from the moment i checked in the hotel staff was super nice and accomodating although the room i had originally booked wasnt ready yet they held my luggage amp offered me three other choices of rooms in the meantime while i wait for my room that was just the beginning of the large spectrum of wonderful service throughout my entire stay the staff was so courteous amp helpful from the insider scoop on what to see to the subway linesstops to take for my daytoday sightseeing to directions on the theater for my broadway show i felt in good hands the entire time it was the most personable conciergestaff experience ive ever had a hotel they were just downright amazing the room was magnificent definitely elegant yet handy with a microwave to heat up leftovers in the kitchen room was a good size with a nice bathroom amp walkin closet i also went online to their website w my reso and ordered specialty pillowsextras up to free of charge all in all a great trip with a great hotel i will definitely stay here again,Positive
as far as nyc hotels go this one is one of the best large rooms with kitchens that have stove fridge microwave everything to make your stay more comfortable and convenientthe beds were excellent and staff very accomodatingright across from msg and penn stationwithin walking distance of times square,Positive
stayed here for just one night while attending a trade show at the javitts center the location was very convenient for this purposethe suite was very large and the bathrooms were a major plus the staff was very attentive room service was prompt and the food good room was well supplied and clean i would definitely stay here again,Positive
this is our second stay in this welllocated hotel right across from penn station and madison square gardens we love the homelike feel the convenience of the kitchen and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff the beds are so perfectly comfortable and the room is so spacious this place is a great valuethe only downside is that the window treatments are a bit dirty and need cleaning likewise the carpet could use a shampoo but overall a fabulous and happy stay,Positive
so glad we stayed at this hotel we were leaving by train so it was helpful that penn station was right across the street this hotel had the best location to min walk to times square originally i wanted to book a hotel in times square but now so glad i didnt times square was so loud so crowded so busy that it was nice having a hotel close enough to walk there but far enough from all that noise everything is walking distance from this hotel i wish the rooms could have been a little updated but we didnt mind too much because it was super clean my husband and i are planning another trip to new york and will definitely by staying at this hotel again,Positive
stayed at the affinia manhatten an excellent friendly hotel in the perfect location to get to all the great sites directly opposite madison square garden one block away from macys and about minutes walk from times square i cannot wait to go back,Positive
just got back from a four night stay and have to say would recommend to anyone location comfort friendly staff were all excellent the view of the empire state building from the room was a bonus just across from penn station made airport transfer from newark a doddle a tip try the breakfast diners around the hotel they are half the price of those on times square,Positive
i visited the affinia manhattan in august with my partner as part of an extended group i normally stay further up midtown near the park but as we were travelling with a group of friends we thought it would be more fun to all stay in the same hotel we got a fantastic rate through ebookers for six nights at the affinia and flights from a uk airport for approximately per person having read a few of the reviews on here about the hotel we were a bit worried about what we would be getting i would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are on a budget and can get a good deal the lobby is lovely and the staff are very friendly we stayed on the th floor and although this isnt very high in nyc terms we had no problems with noise our room was large with a super king size bed which was very comfortable the kitchen area had a large fridge which was handy for bringing in snacks and drinks and there were also facilities to make teacoffee etc the bathroom was particularly small and i would say this was one of the negative sides of the room we had a small shower no bath and small sink and toilet i would recommend asking for a room with a bath as one of our friends stayed in a room with a larger bathroom which was much nicer the room was very clean and comfortable although a little tired decor wise the wallpaper could do with replacing but for the cost you cannot complain the room service from niles bar was excellent very quick and delicious the bar itself is very modern with a good drinks list and attentive bar staff the hotel is in a handy location if you are looking to get to all areas of manhattan its a minute walk from chelsea which is a nice area to wander around and about a minute walk from times square the subway is across the road from this hotel which i would recommend using as it is quick and reliablei would recommend this hotel if you are on a budget and looking for a central location at a good rate,Positive
arrived saturday september and stayed nights will who is super friendly and helpful checked us in with no hassles offered us a complimentary ugraded room bathrooms living room bedroom with double beds and kitchenette our group consisted of women celebrating a th birthday so the bathrooms were much appreciated the kitchenette had a full size fridge small stove sink microwave dishes utensils pots amp pans etc we did use the fridge the micro and the dishes the living room had a pullout sofa bed we did not use a tv and desk the bathrooms were nice sized for ny i would guess the water was always hot and the water pressure was great there are a lot of electrical outlets to plug in chargers phones etc no worries there the room was much cleaner than i expected housekeeping did a great job they even washed the dishes we never had to wait long for an elevator the location cant be beat right across the street from penn stationmadison square garden a short walk to times square empire state building shopping etc i was not bothered by any street noise as others have suggested we were on the th floor and had our windows open for fresh air there is a police and fire station just around the corner but that noise didnt bother me and i am a light sleeper we did walk a lot put in long days and were very tired we felt very safe at all times not the least bit uncomfortable there is a bagel shop just across the street with really good food a market and a dunkin donuts right next door restaurants delis bars and shops are everywhere carl the doormanbellhop was always friendly and helpful every person i encountered at the front desk was friendly helpful courteous etc i just cant say enough good things about the entire friendly staff this hotel is in the perect location get a map from the concierge and go we walked everywhere to central park the financial district so ho no ho little italy the brooklyn bridge etc granted it is a hike but youll be amazed at what you will see that you might otherwise miss i will recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to ny and would definitely stay here again on a return trip thanks affinia manhattan,Positive
painless checkinhelpful staffnothing too much troublegreat roomscomfy bedsadded bonus of a kitchenexcellent location for exploring ny concierge booked us a table at niles restaraunt next door we were highly delighted check out our review of niles on tripadvisor,Positive
we enjoyed our stay at the affinia mamhatten the rooms were large by ny standardsthe rooms furniture rugs were a bit old but clean bathrooms were very small but clean the vents were quite dusty the only bad part was the sofa bed was very uncomfortable it was like sleeping on a metal cage i would not get a room with a pull out again,Positive
affinia manhattan is the best hotel i stayed in nyc the service is first class rooms are spacious and the kitchen and office were a nice surprise i will be coming back,Positive
wellpriced we got a deluxe br suite with baths and used the lr for a second bedroom fold out couch was just fine tv in each room helped kitchen was clean and nice most but not all of their quotdeluxequot br suites have baths some have only one and some of those with one have it in the bedroom rather than in a central location so beware and be sure you get the bath if that is what are you want or the one where it is central rather than in the bedroom what is totally wierd is that the website explains none of this and the prices of all three options are identical go figurestaff helpful quite cheery we stayed opn the d floor which essentially eliminated the street noise of the penn station across the street and madison square garden block north we could walk easily to chelsea or to time square area subway short block from hotel dunkin doughnuts for cheap breakfast great coffeee just outside the side street entrance d street,Positive
we loved the affinia manhattan our room on the th floor was very spacious and meticulously clean the kitchenette was very useful for breakfast and snacks we had no noise problems and slept like babies the staff was very helpful and pleasant from the checkin receptionist to the concierge bellhops and cleaning staff we would definitely stay here again when we visit new york cityjoan bhabha canada,Positive
booked for dollars per night for double roomexcellent location for every subway line across penn station very helpful staff impressive lobbyour room at th floor not near elevatorsask for one spacious with kitchen small but fine bathroomroom was a bit old with noisey ac some sirens for nearby fire station but its in the center of manhattanwould recomment it at a good price,Positive
its situated on th avenue aka fashion avenue between st amp th street west opps madinson square which is an idea spot to do your sightseeing and shopping we did alot of walking every where because most of the places we wanted to see are within walking distance ie emprire state building maceys amp times squarethe rooms are good size which includes a mini kitchen which was handie and the beds are big comfortable staff were friendly amp helpful,Positive
we stayed in this hotel for our th birthday treat i have only complements to pay to the staffwho were friendly and helpfulour room was a studio suite with two double beds which had to be the most comfortable i have ever slept in a hotelthe room was clean and on the th floor we didnt suffer noise problemsthe bathroom are small but functional and cleaned to a high standardthe location was excellenti loved new york and will return with my family next time and i will stay at this value for money hotel thanks to the staff who provide for thier excellent service,Positive
excellent location on the corner of th and st clean and spacious rooms although tiny bathroom but clean and functional helpful friendly staff wouldnt hesitate to stay here again,Positive
a friend and i booked this hotel as part of a girls getaway package for the most part we loved the hotel the location cant be beat its right by madison square garden the staff were very friendly and helpful we easily got recommendations and reservations for dinner via the concierge and for nyc it was a great value the room was soso ive stayed at the waldorf and w hotels in nyc so maybe im a bit spoiled but this seemed like an apartment conversion with the big kitchen small bathroom etc the furniture was dated and seemed to be rundown while lobby seemed grand the rooms were not if youre looking for luxury keep looking,Positive
spacious room with king sized bed and tv kitchen had huge fridgefreezer and cooker which allowed us to eat what and when we wanted the shower was superb staff were friendly and helpfull very good value for money i cannot wait to return to nyc and hopefully can book in the affinia,Positive
stayed here with my partner from dec th th in hotel is so easy find just ask for madison square garden and its literally right opposite it only mins to times square after check in we went to our room which was on a high floor spotless room with big bedroom big living area and decent kitchen but toilet was tiny and i mean tiny it didnt have a bath and only had a really small shower area i asked the guy at reception if we could get a room with a bath and he said he had a room on a lower floor but would rather locate us on a higher floor less street noise if we were willing to wait an extra day and promised us the room would be lovely we opted to wait for the high floor and when we arrived back on day from being out all day we were assigned to our new room which already had our luggage moved there by the staff this room was fab no extra charge massive bedroom with ensuite massive bathroom all you could ask for highly reccommed this hotel clean helpful good value spaciousand very central,Positive
the hotel is in a great location opposite madison sq garden and block from maceys penn station is over the rd so its really easy to use the subway and buses the staff in the hotel were really helpful our room was a really good size and had everything we needed could maybe be modernizedwe would definitely stay here again was really good value,Positive
fantastic proximity to penn station and room was sooooooo cleanbrand new carpet and two wonderfully clean and stylish bathroomstrue the sirens on the fire trucks were noisy but hey we were in central manhattan not an ocean retreatkitchen really handy but we ate out or had take awaystwo lovely bakery cafes one right opposite and one on next block called europa cafe fab breakfasts and snacks in both found staff friendly and efficient king kong cuddly toy on bed was a nice touch but then realised it cost we left it on rd floor and kids loved thatwe did request itwas really concerned by some reports i had read but our experience was wonderful and i loved the space this place offered as a retreat from the full on experience that is new york did not pay for wifi as this is a rotten hidden charge that i personally resent as so many really low cost places manage to include in the room cost hope mr affina is reading this,Positive
when we booked this hotel it was ranked much higher on ta around in nyc now down to th and to be honest i can see why it has fallen down the rankings slightlydont get me wrong we enjoyed our stay here the lobby area is impressive and our room was spacious complete with a small kitchen the restaurant was not cheap but equally not overly expensive by ny standards and the breakfast was very good as was the service location was also good near msg and penn station in that we could walk pretty much everywhere in manhattan the only time we got a bus was when visiting liberty islandhowever it was very noisy there were constant sirens outside our room and at times it was difficult to sleep the night we arrived a bomb went off in times square one of the concierge staff also seemed rather haughty we booked tickets to a broadway show there but he gave the impression that he was almost doing us a favour and was quite pushy in getting us to spend money it made us feel slightly uncomfortable so after that we only approached the concierge desk when he wasnt on dutywhile i would stay here again if required as the price was not unreasonable around for nights i think if we ever visit nyc again i will look for something better,Positive
ive taken my two children on trips into the city for the day but usually dont stay overnight because it is so expensive i was able to get a great rate for this hotel on priceline so we decided to stay for two nights this hotel is an excellent value i dont think you can beat it the staff were great at the front desk amanda is one i remember plus the people at the concierge desk were excellent we were able to buy our tix to the american museum of natural history there and saved lots of time online when we arrived the kitchen in the room was great because we went to the little grocery store one door down and got milk for cereal in the morning and yogurt we didnt use the stove or microwave because we ate out for lunch and dinner but it would be great to have a kitchen for a longer stayi thought the hotel was in very good condition yes you can go elsewhere to get brand new carpeting and fancier bedspreads and furniture but you will pay a lot more for that we hardly spent any time in the room and were more than happy with the quality of the accommodations we really loved this hotel and would definitely stay again,Positive
recently stayed at this hotel after successfully bidding for the room on priceline the room was large by ny standards with a sitting area and a small kitchenette the bed was very comfortable there was a mix up when we returned to the hotel after an excursion to western ny for several days we arrived very late at night we had called to give notice of our late arrival but there were no rooms available when we reached the hotel through great customer service the staff managed the situation very well and sent us to the affinia dumont for our stay also a very comfortable facility and our room was more than adequate,Positive
we stayed here for our honeymoon and after looking at their impressive website decided that this was the place for us we booked room only as we were planning to see relatives as well as all the usual sights despite the pretty lobby and friendly staff i was needless to say that i was very disappointed with the room it was small and quite tatty the carpet had seen better days as had the decor whilst i appreciate we hadnt booked a suite or a posher room i was disappointed that i spent all that money on a very very basic room you are quite simply paying for the location i would go back to the hotel however i would recommend booking a better room than we had,Positive
i stayed one night at the affinia manhattan because its close to penn station and i had an early train i literally was standing on the train platform within minutes of leaving my room in the morning cant beat the locationi was amazed at the large size of the room and that it was a suite complete with a separate kitchen the room was comfortable very clean and updated i also had a drink at the bar downstairs which is friendly and stylishand stylish is not something you find a lot of in the madison square garden districtbut the real plus was that i accidentally left my beautiful leather agenda book in the room and didnt realize it for days after leaving i called housekeeping and they said they had it and once i gave them my fedex number they shipped it to me immediately i received it two days later with the cash still inside that i leave there for emergencies i was so thrilled with the level of service and can only say i highly recommend this hotel thank you so much affinia,Positive
stayed for a night in the affinia manhattan great location right across from penn station the lobby is impressive but my room was a little quotwornquot updated bedding and furniture but the carpet had seen better days and the window ac was loud there was a kitchen didnt use but would be useful for a longer trip my annoyance was that there was a squealing noise coming through my bathroom vent called front desk and they said theyd take care of it but it persisted i was out for most of the evening but no attempt by the management to leave me a note or message,Positive
im a return visitor to affinia manhattan because i like the place in fact i know the first names of four of the doormen and if i dare walk by the entrance theyll yell from across the streeti got better wifi coverage in the hotel than i expected this time it was good enough for a full session of online meeting rooms synchronous fullduplex video and also strong enough to support qik outside the front door tooi also figured out that the quietest rooms are above the th floor around the corner from the bank of elevators room offered sound sleep much appreciated after a longer than expected trip from ireland,Positive
i have stayed a this hotel at least a dozen times over the past years for busines it would not be my choice but this is where my business colleagues wish to stay however i have more good than bad to say about this hotelfirst the good the location is excellent the hotel is across the street from penn station and madison square garden you have easy access to the trains and subways i take the subway most of the time it is perfectly safe to do so and not very expensive the subway can get very crowded the beds are extremely comfortable it is very nice to have a kitchen area with full size refierator to store snacks and leftovers and keep beverages cold you can walk to times square or take take the subwaynow the bad the area is very noisy the windows are old and have window air conditioning units i have been as high as the th floor and still heard honking and sirens all night also i have had rooms with maintenance issues for example during one recent trip a window in the room had no shade,Positive
having booked this hotel through priceline i was a little anxious about the room they were going to give me i arrived in midtown at am the front desk staff was extremely polite i asked if they had a room ready and sure enough they did it was a studio suite on the th floor out of floors i believe it was on the back side of the building with a view of the empire state building the room had a very comfortable king sized bed small kitchen and decent amount of room to relax or store luggage i didnt have any te bathroom was small only one person could fit at a time but that wasnt an issue for me both the room and the hotel were very clean the ac in the room worked great i didnt use the kitchen to cook but having the refrigerator to store drinks was helpful despite being on a low floor there was no problem with street noise as other reviews have suggestedthe location was the best thing about the affinia it was right across from madison square garden and close to most of the touristy stuff without being in the middle of the obnoxiously disneyfied times square it was directly across from the penn station subway lines and a few blocks from the herald square subway lines there were some pretty good restaurants in chelsea and hells kitchen that were within walking distance although the area directly surrounding the hotel wasnt exactly hoppin at nightoverall great stay great value would definitely stay again,Positive
the affinia manhattan is a real gem the hotel was perfect for the fiveday trip my wife and i took with our two children and to new york city my wifes parents stayed in the same hotel in their own room it is located across the street from penn stationmadison square garden which means that accessing transportation is a breeze it is also only blocks which isnt that far at all south of times square two blocks from the empire state building two blocks from macys and a short walk to fifth avenue shopping we even walked to central park and back there are several small grocery stores and delis in the area which is perfect since every room in the hotel has a kitchenette that includes a mediumsized refrigerator a stove a microwave a sink and a toaster there are also several fast food restaurants nearby and a dunkin donuts just steps from the side door the staff was friendly hospitable and extremely helpful the rooms are large massive by new york standards the beds were extremely comfortable and guests are offered different pillow options the price was unbelievable the rooms were worth at least times what we paid we could not have been happier i highly recommend the affinia manhattan to anyone who wants to stay in a great hotel with rare amenities in the middle of manhattan,Positive
my mum and i visited new york on the st july for a whole week and we stayed at the affinina manhattan we could not fault this hotel its location is perfect it is not far from times square blocks from macys and the empire state building is just around the corner all of the hotel staff were very friendly helpful and polite we stayed in room which looked out onto madison square garden the room was big and extremely clean about half way through the week our kitchen light stopped working so we wrote a note for the housekeeping and went out when we returned a couple of hours later it had been replacedlots of people have written on tripadviser about the street noise that you can hear in the rooms you have to remember that you are in new york city one of the busiest cities in the world and the city that never sleeps if you want peace and quiet you shouldnt really be in new york we did all of the normal tourist attractions times square macys the empire state building a bus tour strawberry fields the american museum of natural history central park zoo top of the rock ground zero stpauls chapel the statue of liberty a river cruise the titanic museum and the bronx zoo all of them are fabcentral park zoo is brilliant value for money and has beautiful polar bears we found that the top of the rock was better than the empire state building because it was less crowded and you can see a brilliant view of the empire state which you cannot do when you are on it both are a must do though ground zero is a must see st pauls chapel has a memorial to take tissues the other thing we were impressed by was the new york subway we had heard lots of negative things about the subway but we decided to brave it in order to get to the bronx zoo it is cheap and it is valid for hours takes you straight to your destination and you can use on buses we had never been abroad before and chose new york for our first destination some people told us we were mad we had the best time ever the people of new york are very friendly and always happy to help it was everything we wanted it to be and more,Positive
hotel was okay needs renovation not terrible but dated room was spacious bed was comfortable sleep was peaceful stayed for two nights on floor very quiet loved the fridge would stay again god willing,Positive
to begin w the staff at this hotel is probably one of the best ive ever experienced they were pleasant knowledgeable and professional the affinia manhattan is a gem the room x twin beds offered more than enough comfort space for my yr old twins my wife and myself the kitchenette was a plus the beds were very comfortable as were the pillowsthe bath was a bit small but the water pressure was excellent the ac had a sleep modevery nice we had a th floor corner room looking down on th amp the gardenyes a bit noisy street noise but what do you expect the only complaint is the wifi charge of per hr we decided to leave our laptop home overall this was a great choice and we would definitely stay there again and highly recommend this hotel,Positive
i have stayed at the affinia manhattan six times now and this time i treated myself to a suite on the th floor firstly the views were amazing the empire state building on one side and downtown manhattan on the other the suite itself was bigger than my first apartment a living room with two settees an office area and a tv also a fully equipped kitchen a bedroom with a bed that could have slept four and another tv a good sized bathroom large shower and two closets for the price you wont get anything better in manhattan and a great location too,Positive
first impression location itself was great very close to penn station and herald square mta stops the walk to times square and a host of other notable attractions was brief and doable there is a dunkin donuts starbucks bagel haven and a great little convenience store on the block now the firehouse downstairs adds to the essence of nyc i guess it wasnt really that bad but it was noticeable along with the general noise of the city we did ask for the room on the highest available floor and the staff accommodated us with a room on the th floor the lobby and reception area was nice the staff from the bellman to the desk agents were pleasant checkin seemed to follow a fairly standard formatthe room like many others have stated the rooms are dilapidated and there isnt anything trendy or chic about this hotel however the beds are comfortable the bathrooms are nice you have a variety of pillow choices the rooms have kitchens and the housekeeping staff are personable there are window ac units and they are noisy but effective the tvs are old but the cable selection is good no wireless access in the room other stuff the quotbusiness centerquot is a money pit you have to pay by the minute minimum to browse the net and they charge per page to print anything other than your airline boarding pass i gave my visa debit card upon checkin for incidentals i booked through pricelinecom and the reservation was prepaid i specifically asked the agent who happened the be the operations manager if i was going to see a massive pending transaction she said that i wouldnt later i went to the atm to get cash and i find out that my entire budget for the trip was tied up in a pending transaction at the hotel i immediately went back and the staff had switched shifts the evening agent called the bank and got the process rolling but later dropped the ball on getting the issue corrected later i made my way up to the manager on duty and he finally took care of their part of getting the charges reversed because they hotel dropped the ball i was without funds for two of my days in nyc they manager faxed the forms late in the day and it processing wouldnt begin til the next morningwhich would take hours to process finally it was fixed not once did the hotel apologize for their mistake demonstrate accountability or attempt to accommodate me in any way other than working with the bank please pay careful attention to the charges at checkin and many hotel industry workers advise that you not use a checkdebit card for incidental authorizations,Positive
a little worried by some reviews i had read but this really was a great place to stay large rooms very comfortable big bed and choices of pillow when i asked for a different pillow it came quickly with no problem everyone was cheerful and friendly found the dunkin doughnuts just by the side entrance very useful for breakfast ideal location if you take the train in from newark airport ideal location for seeing new york my bedroom looked straight out at the empire state buildingall arrangements went smoothly bathrooms in suite and really big fridgefreezer to store drinks and food from deli next to hotel really great place to stay,Positive
hotel was beautiful and plushvery friendly professional stafflocation perfect if arriving by train at penn station just across the street easy walk to time square rooms were very big great view very comfortable bed and very nice sheets very clean as well kitchen had dishes silverware full fridge and microwave although we didnt cook we were able to have snacks etc in the room and keep drinks coldwe paid night a great value for this high quality room especially in nyc,Positive
my husband and i stayed here for nights for our st anniversary the hotel was recommended to us by hubbys brother as he had honeymooned there a couple years ago and they stayed days and were very pleased as were we there had been a room deal on the affinia website for early june and when i called to ask about it but expressed an interest in a room with a terrace they couldnt provide one at the special price but they did give me a break on the room price i received several emails from the hotel prior to our arrival reminding me to choose our pillows selections and a free kit to use while you are there which were a yoga kit a wine tasting kit or a walking tour kit which came with headphones an ipod and a set of cards with touring walks i chose that one but in the end we didnt use it you do want to keep the kit safe as they will charge you of course if anything happens to the ipodthe location is great we took the train from philadelphia to penn station and walked across the street and we were there at the hotel the hotel is one of the nice old fashionedlooking buildings on the outside but a modern lobby that is sort of pointless actually i guess if you are meeting someone and need a place to sit somewhere its ok but somehow it feels like they havent exactly finished it the staff were all very very nice and accomodating the concierges were great our first room was on the th floor and our terrace looked out across a ushaped space to the rooms terraceless opposite us as well as both side streets and a variety of fascinating apartments and one building next door that was having the brick removed by workmen that was fascinating to watchbut there was no romantic view when i called the desk to see if there was another room with a new york view they said they could move us on friday to a higher floor and we were happy the room had a huge bed and the room appointments were very classy black brown silver and gold colors on the bed furnishings it had a kitchen with a small under counter fridge a microwave dishes silverware all the trappings which came in handy as our first meal in nyc was right after wed come down from the empire state building watching a huge rainstorm eat upper manhattan we ducked into the main noodle house at th avenue feeling very newyawkish the menu was huge they had a delivery boy on a bike who came and went and tons of people coming in for take out we got two dishes one of which was beef and green bean and ginger which was fabulous both dishes were better than most chinese food ive had and we took the left overs with us as we had the means to reheat and reeat in our roomfriday we moved up to the th floor and there from our shared terace this time was the empire state building in all her lit up glory and from the bedroom window you could see the chrysler building between a couple other tall buildings if you stood just right now this room was a completely different configuration it had a hallway from the main room past the kitchen which this time had a full sized refrigerator around a corner to the terrace door and a large closet with a mirrored front the terrace was shared with a room down a lonely hall but which had a window from the hall that opened onto our balcony there was a large iron fence with the middle blocked out so you wouldnt see your neighbors exactly in the end i preferred room the first room over room view of the empire state notwithstanding plus it poured friday night so we were only able to enjoy the sight for a bit on saturday night other than sirens there was no noise we noticed the toiletries were lovely the bathrooms in the two rooms were also completely different having the nicer larger area but neither was large by any standard they were clean and brightwe were able through the concierge desk to get tickets to see god of carnage which won tonys on our anniversary very expensive tickets through a broker but the tonys were days away and we had right end nd row mezzanine seats which were better than the box seats in front of us and im truly sorry i cant remember the name of the woman who helped us the most my husband noticed she and i had the same glasses she was wonderful and very patient with us we also wanted to eat at patsys italian restaurant at w th st which was frank sinatras apparent favorite place to eat italian in ny or so we were told teensy bar two floors packed with diners lots of famous photos on the downstairs walls and fabulous food this was our anniversary dinner and they gave us a gift bag with a jar of spaghetti sauce to take homewe took the metro everywhere pretty easy to use selfticket machines and very well marked routes funny thing is they go up and down the island but to get across you take the bus or you go from times square across to grand central station by subway where there is no place to sit in the main terminal you wanna sit you go down to the food court where they have lots of nice places to eat and drink and hilariously large peewees playhouse type overstuffed plastic chairs to sit innever having been to nyc before we tried to fit in as much tourist stuff as possible empire state ellis islandwe were too late to get tickets for entry to lady liberty so we passed up getting off there if you are interested at all in how america got its eastern european population ellis island would take up most of your day anyway the headphpnes are a must to tour the main building the museum also is very well done but we didnt have enough time it would have taken all day and we couldnt do that the boat ride is fun too the upstairs bow area gets quite crowded and theres no where to sit if you want to sit at all get in line early the tickets are available in the fort at battery park im sure there must be other places to get them but we werent very well prepared with information on this trip and we slept in because the bed was so comfywalked by the world trade center site but couldnt find the memorial the area is blocked by fences and machinery the little church facing the site has a wonderful memorial in it we also went to the museum of natural history on a very rainy friday lessondo not go first thing in the morning if it is a week day and a school day all the kids in manhattan are probably on school tours you can see plenty if you wait till after lunch the school kids are gone by about the self check in at the museum is great except we thought we were getting tickets to see the planetarium and while we got to pick addons to the initial entry the planetarium was not one of those items in the end after wandering around in utter confusion the info desk in the planetarium actually comped us tickets to the planetarium show we were very pleased and amazed by the overall helpfulness and courtesy of everyone we encountered in nycmust doif you are tired of walking take the sing it with me nowthe three hour tour from circle line tours that goes entirely around the island the tours are not from the ellis islandliberty island dock dont make that mistake ask your conceirge again and they usually can print timed tickets for you for the tours at no additional cost then when you are done cross the street and go to celebrity bowling and have a guiness on tap some really unusual bowling alley food that can almost be calld gourmet and watch the movies or glow bowling or whatever is going on we had a martini at the roof garden of the metropolitan museum of art and also ate dinner there which was very good and it was wonderul looking into the museums first floor area and out the big window into central park also do not miss the frick gallery if you like art close up two vermeers right there you can see the brush strokes give your self more than hours though we went after the mus nat history on that rainy fridayall in all we were very pleased with the whole experience and oh those beds at the affinia i would definitely stay there again,Positive
my husband and i travelled to new york for the first time in february we had absolutely no idea what to expect from this hotel but i can assure you we were pleasantly surprised the good points big room comfy bed cleaned daily plenty of storage and most importantly a kitchen it was brilliant saved so much money we ended up doing a small shop for essentials like cereals bread milk etc we got up at our leisure every morning watched sky tv and had breakfast in peace i cant bear all that bleary eyed buffet breakfast room nonsense that you get in hotels where they dictate what time you will get up and eat it also helped us after a hard days sightseeing the last thing i wanted to do at night was go out and eat its really expensive and the restaurants are not that great so we would grab take out somewhere and take it back to the room perfectalso it is perfectly located close enough to walk everywhere yet far enough away that you can get away from the madness for five minutesstaff cant do enough for you there is a tourist info booth in the hotel lobby use thembad points the bathroom is tiny it is only big enough for one person i am ft size and i felt claustraphobic if you are big people maybe go somewhere else the decor could do with updating and there was a bit of a draft through the windowsoverall this hotel was perfect for what we wanted i would def go againtry going down to niles restaurant for a really tasty cosmopolitango across the road for brilliant bagels cant remember the name come out of main hotel entrance cross the road turn to your left and walk until you need to cross again the bagel shop is on your right,Positive
ive stayed in ny twice before but i have to say this unassuming midtown hotel really ticked all the boxes first the location is just fantastic you are always going to have a little walking to do in new york but the affinia is within easy blocks of times square and broadway just to the empire state building and macys madison sq garden literally across the road and the main ny post office for posting all your overweight purchases back home is only block or take an taxi ride to the circle line boat tour around ny harbour really greatthe affinia is definitely an older style hotel but its comfortable in that description and doesnt charge like a wounded bull for the privilege everything worked was well placed and didnt jar for us we could use free wifi by sitting in the lobby in front of the elevators and piggybacking the dunkin donuts network next door everyone does it dont worry the staff were very helpful and even allowed us to checkin hours early after a particularly rough flight over something they didnt have to dono complaints with a deal in hand on the room rate this hotel is one of the best options ive found for the big apple,Positive
very nice we arrived late and recieved at upgraded room at only nice rooms great service location was perfect for us there was some street noise but it is the city that never sleeps we will probably not return unfortunatly because we need our marriott points but till i would reccomend it to anyone,Positive
stayed for nights in july and as a party of including one infant we had booked two seperate one bedroom suites we had no special requests apart from beng on the same floor if possible but even that wasnt essential having stayed at the hotel before we knew what to expect or so we thoughtto put it mildly one of the rooms we were allocated was awful totally depressing with practically no natural light barely enough room to walk around the bed so where the crib for the infant was supposed to go was a mystery to us perhaps in the bathroom on previous occasions we have also stayed in a one bed suite at this hotel and were pleased with a decent sized bedroom two seperate bathrooms and nice open living areanot so on this occassion much much smaller rooms no natural light whatsover with the adjacent buildings being so close on two sides one very small bathroom and perhaps as some form of welcome gift a half consumed bottle of white wine in the fridge the only thing that had not changed wa sthe price we had paid which wasnt cheapeventually after several phone calls and being told that no other rooms were available until the next day we were moved to room which was a great improvement but still no more than we had booked and paid fortwo other problems during the stay worth mentioning on one morning the bed wasnt even half made up by the maid duvet was thrown on the bed but underneath the sheets were still all crumpled and had obviously not been touched and our request for a late check out extra hours couldnt be accomodated despite the fact that after checking in it took them almost an hour and a half to rectify the poor accomodation they initially provided us withwe had a great few days in new york but the affinia didnt contribute to our enjoyment on this occassion as you might see from our other posts we rarely if ever have any complaints so its quite unusual for us to be so negative but on this occassion it is warrantedthe big apple has lost none of its shine but the affinia manhattan certainly has and we wont ever stay there again,Positive
we hadnt been to new york before but we were really glad that our travel agent suggested this hotel it was very comfortable and the staff were extremely helpful location is excellent with times square empire state building and macys all within walking distance,Positive
usd including taxes was excellent pricequality for th july weekend kingsize bed a lot of space for luggage and a kitchenette pillow menu and other little free extras like hairdryer for curly hair were plus service desk in the middle of lobby was great they helped with question concerning the city of ny,Positive
this hotel was lovely huge spacious rooms with a kitchen area aveda products in the bathroom toothis hotel was in awesome location couldnt wish for betterthe staff were really helpful and polite and nothing was too much troublewould recommend this hotel and would love to stay again,Positive
my mom dad husband and i recently spent six nights in the affinia manhattan we had a suite with one bedroom bathrooms livingdining combo a kitchen and closets this arrangement provided us with more space then we had ever even hoped for the rooms were quite comfortable if not a little quottiredquot and quotdatedquot but for the price we paid we couldnt complain we found a great deal on travel zoo and the friendly reservation clerk allowed me to book direct matching the price we were minutes from the subway and used it as our mode of transportation almost exclusively the concierges desk was always staffed with helpful friendly knowledgeable people who were always happy to answer our questions or give us directions to this place or that we were only one subway stop from times square and just a few stops to most other sights i would recommend this hotel to anyone who desires a clean comfortable reasonably priced place to stay,Positive
when we arrived we were allocated a room on the th floor the shower dripped all night the air con was broken and we could not open the curtains when we complained the next morning we were given a smaller although very noisy room on the th floor which was clean and comfortable staff on reception were a delight and the hotel manager gave me half my internet rental back because it went down for a day which was very generous the location is amazing and a good choice for all the attractions once you learn how the subway and busses work if we returned to new york we would certainly consider staying here again a fantastic week exploring new york and macys round the corner has loads of bargains,Positive
booked through priceline stayed here for nights with wife and kids plenty of room great view from rm quiet and safe excellent laundry facility penn central has everything needed at good prices cvs breakfast etc much cheaper than breakfast buffet close to macys subway and times square second stay and would stay again,Positive
much better than we expected after reading of tired rooms in some reviews they certainly arent up to the minute in decor but were spotlessly clean staff were without exception warm friendly and professional only slight drawback was when we checked in as our room wasnt ready the receptionist offered alternative rooms we said which did she think would be the best and she suggested one which was huge and with larger beds than the room we had booked naively i ssumed the cost would be thesame until i looked at the receipt in the taxi as we left yup more fool me note to self check receipt before leaving and dont be too polite to ask quotwill that cost us morequotwhen offered alternative rooms would stay there again if travelling with kids tho,Positive
my friend and i were first timers to new york and this proved to be a great location we walked everywhere and with macys starbucks a little grocerydeli next door and one of the best italian restaurants ive eaten at just a few steps from the hotel this was a great find sure the rooms are a little dated but we found them very clean and spacious my room smelled of smoke when i checked in so i rung reception and they changed my room no problem to a much bigger room in fact and went out of their way to ensure i was happy with the new room the conceirges were very helpful we ate at the restaurant twice the the food was fine and similarly priced to restaurants elsewhere the only negative was the noise i was near the fire station and they seemed to come and go all night i suspect in ny being the city that never sleeps a lot of noise is fairly typical so it probably isnt any worse that anywhere else overall a very good location and competitvely priced for new york,Positive
centrally located for travel tofrom penn station small kitchen handy for self catering breakfast and pricey shop nearby for fruits etc fire brigade next door could wake you up every night also very central for walking to all major attractions such as central park maceys times square etc,Positive
we stayed here for nights and found our room very large for new york with a separate bedroom and a pull out couch in the living room in order to save money we used the kitchen every dayit all worked and the fridge was full size the staff at the concierge desk went out of their way to make our stay pleasant gave us directions and they always asked if there was anything else we needed it is in a central location right across from madison square garden clean comfortable and a true bargain the street noise took a day to get used to but i loved leaning out the window and watching the cabs and people mill around penn station we will stay here again next time were in new york,Positive
the hotel is located in a great spot it is across the way from penn stationmadison square garden it is close to all the spots you will want to visit and those that are kinda far you can take the subway the hotel staff are great and very helpful the outside of the hotel and the lobby are nice the rooms are roomy but do need to be updated alittle its a clean hotel and they offer a selection of pillows and kits that can be helpful the bar and restaurant are nice but alittle pricey most of the rooms do not offer much of a view unless you are facing th ave i stayed in a bedroom suite that had bathrooms a living room and a kitchen it can get noisy due to the traffic but not a big deal,Positive
we have just returned from a night stay with our teenage children we had a bedroom suite which was really large and had bathrooms location was really good just a short walk to time square and only blocks from macys we stay at the dumont last year and both hotels are equally good the aveda products are a real bonus would stay at either hotel if i were going back to new york,Positive
my husband and i just spent nights at the affinity manhattan based on other trip advisor reviews if you come into penn station by train the location is greatpractically across the streetso having luggage is no problem check in was quick and clerk very friendly the best part was that we arrived at am on a friday morning and we were able to check into our room within a few minutes of settling into the room they delivered an quotexperience kitquot see below that i had ordered online we reserved a br suiteit has separate rooms kitchen living room and bedroom it really has the feel of an apartment rather than a hotel room so if that appeals to your needs i highly recommend it of course the suite is more expensive that smaller rooms and i didnt see any of the smaller rooms so i cannot comment on themprosthe suite is spacious and bright with large windows we were on the th floor with wonderful sweeping views of the cityliving room has sofa comfortable chair large very nice desk tv and large windows the sofa in lr is a pull out bed so this would work well for couple with childrenkitchen stocked with basic supplies including coffee pot toaster dishes etc stove full size refrigerator and microwaveyou could cook a meal here if you really wanted to but pots and pans limited has a window housekeeping washes the dishes they dont always do that a little store just a few doors down the street has the basics you might need or bring them with youroom was clean bed very comfortable tv and large windows you can choose the types of pillows on the bedalso when you make your reservation go to their website and order an quotexperience kitquot which is a little perk that affinia hotels offer great midtown location easily accessible to penn station madison square station we felt safe in the area even in the evening because there is a lot of activityconswe didnt find any of the cons to be a problem but some folks mightthis didnt bother us but this is an older hotel and is not luxe although the lobby is very prettyalso notice the beautiful old elevators room was furnished more like someones apartmenta mix of furniturenot all matching hotel type furniture i can be picky about hotels but i found this kind of quotretroquot and comfortablebathroom is very small and not fancy no tub just a shower but it was large and water pressure and temperature worked finewindow air conditionersbut they cooled well and we didnt think they were noisy or bothersome you are able to adjust the temperture,Positive
my husband and i stayed there july to four night stay they upgraded us as they new we were celebrating our th wedding annivesary and got a suite with a separate bedroom full kitchen living room and a large balcony with table and chairs overlooking madison square gardens incredible people were all friendly and the concierge was very helpful with all our questions we will definitely be staying at the affinia manhattan again they made it very memorable for ushappy patrons from toronto ontario canada,Positive

me and my wife spent part of our honeymoon at the affinia from june th to june nd we got an excellent deal at travelzoo day with taxes which for midtown is an excellent pricewe got a studio suite which had excellent space a small kitchen with a fridge oven toaster and coffee make and pots and pans some complain about the size of the bathroom but for us it was more than enough you could see that the room is a bit old but its very well kept and cleani didnt try the room wifi but they have a business center with internet access in the lobby which was a bit expensive they have a concierge at the center of the lobby which can arrange tickets for several attractions very handy and with nice service especially from ashley we didnt try niles the restaurant next door which also offers breakfast servicelocation is excellent right across from penn station we got a metrocard unlimited for a week which is a great bargain since you can travel by subway throughout the entire island hours a day we never felt unsafe walking the streets and subway at nightwe got from jfk using the air train and the lirr and had only to cross the street to get to the hotel its not very good if you have a lot of bags though since you have to go up several floors from penn station to the street and penn station is very busy all day longid definitely recommend the affinia,Positive
just back from one week in nyc which was great and exhausting journey in from newark intl was nice and easy and arrive at penn station literally over the road from the hotel great got our key and see that we were on floor of good start the higher the better turns out we had a view from the lounge and bedroom of the empire state building yay really good sized accomodation apart from the bathrooms the saving grace was that we had bathrooms so at least it was not too much of a squeeze but they really are tiny shower only no bath really good amount of storage folder out bedsofa and chair kitchenette was basic we never really used it though but looked like a lack of pans kettle etc but youre really not going there to use it right we had a suite with seperate bedroom was great safe in room cleaning service was pretty basic in that they seemed to make the bed and maybe change the towels but it was fine we did not really need to use the front desk but there is a dedicated info area during core hours bar was clean location great for first timers as near the station main links to tube and obvious sites such as empire state rockerfeller macys bryant park etc etc even with tubes you will walk a lot so bring only flats number of cafes nearby so no probs with your breakfast bagel or all you can eat suggest you nget takeaway food and head to bryant park nearby for chilled out lunch on one of your first days ease yourself in recommend top of the rock go early no qs during week at am when we went staten island ferry as its free to get your statue of liberty and profile pics of nycsohonolita etc definately worth it if you like shopping do that early and then chill out fo lunchso much more oh and definately get to a broadway show we called up on tues and got tickets directly from box office for thurs for phantom each and views were fine for that price its a relatively small theatrehotel is pretty noisy but i would imagine most places are we were floors up with side windows so if poss request above floor at the side air con is very very loud better to leave one on in the lounge and then leave your bedroom door opendecor okay but place is as others say in need of an uplift it was just a room only then it would appear shabby but we got a great price hotelscom and were so glad we got a suite would recommend it mainly for first time travellers as everything nearby and i would stay here again,Positive
had a four night stay here and all in all it was very enjoyable quite spacious rooms with two queen beds kitchenette with fridge which is a plus but with four people we had only cups bowls etc for three also there was a stove but absolutely no pots pans microwave reheating dishes etc we also had a sofa bed which gave our teenaged daughter her own bed they have a pillow menu which excited aforementioned teenager plus offered walking tours of new york on ipod for free a good bonus for those that want to diy across from madison square gardens a short stroll to the subway amp penn station amp very close walk to largest department store in the world macys also close walk to empire state bldg and not too far from times square also a plus is the hotel is in a police precinct and next door to a fire station and while sirens make up the new york sound scene they arent too obtrusive thru the night it just makes for a safer area to be in would thoroughly recommend if you can get a good deal,Positive
my husband and i stayed at the affinia manhattan from july nd through july th we had a large studio room on the th floor with a view of madison square garden and seventh avenue the room had a comfortable king sized bed a chair with ottoman a work desk with chair a kitchen with a full sized refrigerator gas stove cupboard space and service for two plus a small yet functional bathroom my husband really liked the lighted mirror in the bathroom the room was a little dated in terms of style but it was serviced on a daily basis and was kept clean we slept well every night on the comfortable bed enjoyed the pillow selection and the aveda products were great i definitely recommend requesting a highnumbered floor if making a reservation here we got the special internet rate through affinias website which was even better than the travelzoo rate that i initially reserved the staff at the hotel was wonderful they were very friendly and accommodating we asked for additional toiletries and dish soap and received them immediatelywe also ate at the niles restaurant which is affiliated with the hotel and got off the bill since we stayed at the affinia i believe that special ends through labor dayboth my husband and i would highly recommend staying at the affinia manhattan because of its close proximity to public transportation the large rooms and helpful staff,Positive
i just returned from my first trip to the affinia manhattani say first because i will absolutely be staying there the next time i go to new york i am so glad i found a deal for this hotel and so glad i changed from a very small quothipquot hotel on the upper west side that i just had to post asap the hotel is in a great location i walked everywhereand im not a real quotwalkerquot everything was so close though i just headed out and ended up in chelsea times square the village etc the location even though it was great was not the best part the actual hotel was wonderful i had the smallest room category and it was plenty large for my tastes much larger than many apartments in ny the bed was ultracomfortable there was a small kitchen that i put to very good use a large desk plenty of closet space and a fairsized bathroom i had read several reviews that noted the very small bathrooms but i cant believe that these people have been to apartments in ny because the bathroom was as large as most ive seen and larger than a few even though the hotel is not new and there were a few signes of wear and tear everything was kept immaculately clean still thought the best part was the staff everyone from check in to check out both of which went very quickly the doormen who always greeted one witha smile the helpful and friendly maids and the ladies i spoke with at the concierge deskall had great attitudes believe it ot not im trying to figure out how i can return for another long weekend before school starts i had that great of a time i had breakfast delivered to my room once during my stay and everything was delicious there are also plenty of places within very easy walking distance a few blocks that served every kind of food you can think of i especially enjoyed the place on th that specialized in macncheese and the wonderful barbq restaurant a couple of blocks away i am so staying here againand the sooner the better,Positive
when i initially booked this hotel thru priceline i didnt expect anything spectacular espcially considering the price i paid below including taxes boy what a shock i receivedtook the bus from dc and the bus stopped right across the street from the hotel st street and th avenue block away from madison square garden the outside of the hotel was a bell man and baggage handler which i found to be great the front desk was extremely busy but you could see they took their time with each check in to ensure each guest had everything they needed and all questions were answeredwe checked into room which is right off the elevator but still far enough removed from the noise i walked in to a huge living room which had a table for with a hanging light on the right a nice size couch in the middle of the room with a large leather foot rest amp tv on the right there was a kitchen with full range stove w pots amp pans microwave and fridge there was also a breakfast bar but no stoolsoff to the left there was a desk with chair large coat closet and full bathroom beyond that is the private bedroom with a queen size bed and twin bed tv dresser large walk in closet double mirrored sliding glass door closet and another full bathroomthe beds were extremely comfy and the hotel room was very quiet centrally located near penn station msg macys short walk to times square and near the a b amp c trains overall i have no real complaints other then suggesting they maybe replace the living room couch it was a little tattered id definitely stay here again but i cannot say id stay here for the rack room rate that time,Positive
my brother and i did a quotbaseball road tripquot and yankee stadium was one of the stops we got a great price for the hotel which included all taxes on priceline the only thing to worry about is if you want two beds because we got the room through priceline we were given one double bed there was an extra fee to get a room with two beds also request a quiet room which we did not we were right above th ave which being ny never did quiet downthe hotel is at a perfect location it is right across the street from penn station and there are subway stops everywhere we were able to take a subway stop from th and th directly to yankee stadium without changing subways we are not very picky people so for us the room was great having a room with two beds included a kitchen the bathroom is very small but again it didnt matter to us,Positive
affinia manhattan offered a wonderful experience for me for a two night stay this summer i had great accomodations thanks to janet at the front desk great features of this hotel included a very responsive staff in all areas as a solo traveler the bellmen were great with their offered assistance especially the morning i needed a cab during rush hour and had to check out early also janet at the front desk was so cordial and helped me with my room assignment in a way that made me feel so grateful she also let me know i could have any type of pillow i wanted a great feature from the many offered on their menu selection theres a spa which i didnt have enough time to take advantage of but they also stocked aveda products in their bathrooms which i liked conceierge helped me figure out how to get over to brooklyn using mass transit everyone was great the hotel itself is older but kept up well the location cant be beati was able to walk around for anything i needed a whole foods grocery was only a few blocks walk away and the madison square garden was just across the street i walked downtown to the village from the hotel too it was a great location i would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for an economical place to stay that is adequate and very convenient to all nyc has to offer,Positive
we travel to nyc frequently and have stayed many hotels there staying at the affinia was great first they allowed me to check in at am check in was a breeze second the room was big and spacious with a separate kitchenette third the windows can be opened which is a plus for fresh air we got the reservation online so the price was under a night really great experience it was a tad noisy next door to a fire station and cabs honking but its across from msgpenn sta so thats to be expected walk up to times square and check out the new in the street seating they are experimenting,Positive
i stayed here after getting a great special rate its located right across the street from madison square garden and penn station so a great location if taking the train the staff was very friendly and helpful room was huge two double beds desk chair dresser two closets and a kitchen only problem was the bathroom was very small although nice sink hair dryer also included but there was no room to get dressedthere is a window air conditioner instead of central ac which kept the room cool but because of the window not being totally sealedclosed the noise from the outside was unusually loud i suggest they should put double pane windows or some how seal the windows to minimize the outside noise otherwise the room and hotel were great,Positive
together with my husband and my parents we stayed nights at the affinia manhattan and were delighted with the spacious rooms and central loaction the hallways of the hotel do need updating as do some of the rooms but the provision of a small kitchen in each room was super and allowed us to prepare breakfast each morning before heading off on our sightseeing adventures being opposite penn station also allowed us to easily travel to long island to visit relatives upon checkout the receptionist gave us clear and easy instructions on how to use the long island rail to travel to jkf for our flight home this proved an easy and cost effective journey taking less time than a taxi journey all the staff were very helpful and i would definately recommend the affinia manhattan for its location and spaciousness beware though that the bathrooms in some of the rooms can be small and the showers tiny however our two bedrooms on the th floor were perfect we would definately stay here again,Positive
i stayed at the affinia manhattan for four nights in june first of all the hotel is only steps from penn station which made it very convenient to get to from jfk airport via the long island railroad its location is close enough to times square that you could walk or take the subway which is only one block from the hotel my room was the largest nyc hotel room ive ever stayed in the room had three closets strangely it had a tiny bathroom the size of the bathroom is the only reason i give the hotel stars instead of the shower stall had barely enough room to turn around in i wish they had enlarged the bathroom by taking away one of the closets however the room was very clean and comfortable i had a corner room on the rd floor so i had windows on two sides i could open the windows a bit and let some fresh air in which was very nice the staff was extremely friendly and professional i would definitely recommend the affinia,Positive
my husband and i stayed in this hotel for nights we were on the rd floor the room was lovely and spacious all the staff were friendly and helpful when we needed advicefrom the concierge on where to eat and drink they were very helpful great location for everything it was about mins to half hour walk to central park from the hotel just keep on walking up th avenue and you will hit most of the attractions the rock empire state macys and central park oh and not forgetting times squareacross the road from the hotel are some great bars without having to go miles mustang harrys was great for food and drink,Positive
when we arrived we were immediately upgraded to a suite with bedrooms and baths everything was cleaner than a whistle and the view from the th floor was magnificent the rooms were spacious and charming it was an added bonus to have a kitchen with a fullsize refrigerator that allowed us to keep a few beverages chilled the staff was most helpful throughout our stay and the hotel itself was centrally located to almost everything i wouldnt hesitate to recommend the affinia to any of my friends or stay there again,Positive
overall a good stay clean hotel and room and of a very good size compared to when i stayed at the hudson a few yrs agobathroom slightly small only one person at a time we were on the th floor and u could defiantely here everything that was going on there is a fire station nearby the windows had whithe blinds but these did nothing to stop the light in the morning if u are an early starter and not got a hangover and getting in from clubbing at am then this aint a problem also there was a convention on our floor so lots of ppl milling aroundfriendly staff and overall very good and would prob stay again but i would ask for a top floor,Positive
i read a lot of reviews before booking a hotel in new york city we wanted to stay in the midtown near all the action ofcourse the hotels dont come cheap in midtown manhattan we were people in our family and we had booked the bedroom suite for each couple which we got in usd per room it was a huge sft suite with a very good spacious living area a bedroom and bathrooms in some of the suites it was bang opposite to the penn station blocks from storied macys few blocks from empire state building and time square i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who goes with a family and is looking for a good spacious clean accommodation in midtown dont go by the negative reviews here all hotels in nyc are old and have old elevators old carpet etc but you get a clean properly maintained room with very good linen at affinia and thats what you need in nyc,Positive
enjoyed our stay at affinia manhattan very much great location by madison square garden nice clean rooms including kitchen with fridge stove microwave very friendly staff our tv broke so they sent an engineer prompltly to fix it later they delivered a bottle of wine for the inconvenience plus free pay tv for the rest of the stay we will definetily stay there again next time in nyc cant wait,Positive
i was last week in the hotel we were five people in one bedroom suite for in the rrom and the last in the living room and it was great we had two bathrooms and a clean and great kitchen not noisy at the floor i booked trhough the web and they charged exactelly the price i knew i will recomend this hotel located in the heart of manhattan,Positive
my husband and i went to ny for our st wedding anniversary we were a little skeptical seeing the reviews on here about the affina but we need not of worried as the people who have complained are obviously full time whingers in general lifethe affina is perfectly located within minutes of times sq fifth avenue central park the harbour and other attractions are walkable but a cab can be taken at or so rooms are spacious for ny and have all the ammenites you need and its comfortable amp clean yes the rooms maybe a little dated but do you come to ny to worry about the decor we stayed on th floor and we were happy with the noise level on this floor if you are like us who spent all day out and most of the evening the tiredness takes over we can not thank the conceige enough i think her name was nova who arranged restaurant reservations including a lovely italian for our actual anniversary as well as stand up comedy tickets at carolines on broadway i would throughly recommend speaking to them after all they live there and will show you the real ny not just wendys and mcdonalds we were very lucky to get a good deal on this hotel as i think the general rack rate is quite expensive you are paying prodemently for its location but i can not fault the service housekeeping or anything about this hotel,Positive
our only complaint was no coffee maker even though we had a fairly wellstocked kitchenette thank goodness for the little deligrocery next door,Positive
we stayed at the affainia manhattan what a pleasant surprise the room was very spacious great stay and even better value the only down side was a small bathroom other then that i would not have any complaints had a nice view of the empire state building i would return to this hotel,Positive
after booking this hotel then nervously reading all the negatives reviews i was extremely relieved to realise that people are whingers this hotel is great the location fabulous the staff helpful the rooms large yes the carpet in the hallyway is tired who cares yes the fire trucks police cars are sometimes noisy so what if you want peace and quiet go holiday in antartica youre in manhattan not a retirement home yes the bathroom is a little on the small side so go stay at the plaza if you want a large bathroom stop complaining everyone and enjoy the experiencehave i mentioned the location you can walk downtown or uptown from here it is halfway superb or take the subway across the road central park is about min walk th avenue walking distance as is times square the village and meat packing district about m walk we spent weeks in this hotel and could not fault it the best coffee dunkin donuts next door seriously breakfast tick tock diner th and th or cosmic cafe on wst about a m from the hotel dont miss bleeker st pizza in the village and magnolia bakery balthazar for a great night out at dinner and pastis for the bar scene we were very satisfied travellers from brisbane australia,Positive
i stayed there this past week like other reviwers the place can definitely use a spruce but they also accommodated to my requests ive asked for a higher floor i got a higher floor did not expect the window unit but it truly was the little engine that could and spout out cool air luckily sleeping w windows open was fine too the room i had mustve been a suite of some kind the room itself was spacious one queen bed a chaste a desk a well equipped kitchenette there were decent size closets but the bathroom was x at best two of us girls staying there and none of us wanted to go to the bathroom to change i had more room in the kitchenette hot water took a long time to warm up which made me feel bad for wasting water while waiting for it to warm up the staff was definitely friendly and accommodating except the bell men which did not offer to take my luggage and the doorman was arguing w the cabbie over business that i can do without but for the location its near where i needed to be and close enough to alot of thingsi booked the deal via quikbook but lucky that i checked the hotel website which offered cheaper prices than all the other discount websites for the price i paid and not being there most of the time thats ok definitely could use a bigger bathroom,Positive
stayed here may i agree that this hotel is in dire need of a massive makeover i can only recommend this hotel if you can find a good deal i originally booked under a travelzoo promo but i checked the hotels website a week before our trip and found an even better deal the hallway leading to our room had a stench to it suite was roomy one bedroom wking bed and two bathrooms our rooms linens were clean bathroom was clean enough but the grout around tub area should be redone blinds were dusty kitchen was clean enough but they did not originally provide us with dish soap until the next day the sole escalator only goes oneway down the self serve laundry area is outright creepy,Positive
ive read the other reviews here i must agree the hotel needs a makeover but it was just fine for a girlfriends getaway as we planned to shop take in theatre and be in the room pretty much only to sleep and cook breakfast having the kitchen was a plus for us as we slept in late and were still able to grab our eggs and toast in the room at our leisureour room had two bathrooms which was great for us too id go somewhere else with my husband thoughbecause the hotel is tired,Positive
we were thrilled with this hotel the location is fantastic so close to penn station for cheap airport transfer fare and the subway and surrounded by delis great restaurants and oh so delicious pancake houses we had a junior suite which had double beds a sitting area with table overlooking view of th ave desk usual en suite and best of all a kitchenette with full size fridge freezer microwave and cooker super to come back to our room with deli food have a cold drink gaze at the exciting new york scene below us and recharge our batteriesask for a corner room as you get great views and the higher the better hotel staff were super friendly and helpful and it was very cleanloved the place and definitely would return worth paying that bit extra for we paid per night all inclusivehope this helps you i know its so hard choosing somewhere when you have never been before do realise its right in the hub of things so if you want quiet then its not for you having said that we were on th floor and we could quotseequot but not hear the noise,Positive
i was in new york with a friend april may st and we were looking for a comfortable hotel within walking distance of the major sites and a reasonable price after much deliberation we chose the affinia manhattanwe booked an incredible deal on travelzoo for night for a studio roomwe arrived via taxi from lga and the hotel is super easy to find its kiddiecorner from penn station the lobby is lovely with lots of marble and chairs to hang out in check in took only minutes and we were up in our roomour room was a corner room on the th floor and we had two very comfortable double beds with nice linens a desk a chair a minikitchen fullsized fridge small stove small sink small counter area and dishespansglasses a large closet plus a coat closet and a tiny bathroomwe were very pleasantly surprised with how much room we had so much room that we were able to take the ironing board out and leave it out our entire stay try that at other ny hotelsthe bath was really small definitely a oneperson at a time bath but the tile was updated we had a window that opened and let in natural light and the shower worked great oh and they have aveda productsas i mentioned the beds were very comfy and the linens were crisp but soft and im really picky about my bed and linensoutside of the room we didnt spend much time at all in the neighborhood we heard the place next door niles was good but we didnt have time to check it out we had lunch at cafe europa just up the street one day and we walked to the liquor store about a block or two away to buy some champagne other than that we walked the or so short blocks to times square which we made our home base for starting the day you literally walk out of the hotel and take a right onto seventh avenue and you will run right into times square dont be scared by the blocksit really is a quick walkwe walked to times square the circle line dock central park rockefeller center etc i think we only took a cab twice our entire staythe location was also super convenient for us when we left as we walked right across the street to penn station where we caught a train to long beachas far as service is concerned the ladies at the concierge desk were very helpful and gave us great tips on restaurants and showsthey have room service which was pretty speedy even though the only thing i was ordering was a champagne bucket and glasses sometimes you get an attitude if you dont order foodthe bellman were helpful with luggage and hailed a cab if we needed itoverall the room itself it a little tired and probably needs an update but it was clean and comfortable and an amazing value i wouldnt have minded paying more it was that good we were really happy with our whole stay and there is nothing i can complain about for us we took the night more we would have paid for a mediocre room close to times square and spent it on a show and a nice dinnerwe never had a problem with noise like others mention in their reviews but maybe it was because we were on a high floorif you arent looking for luxury and just want a nice clean convenient place to stay do yourself a favor and give the affinia manhattan a try my bet is you wont be disappointed,Positive
i stayed here because i wanted close proximity to penn station across the street the pros the room is huge by nyc standards i had a separate kitchen and living area i think it would be great for a family with children and would give them plenty of room to spread out cook etc the lobby is very nice and the staff are quite friendly location okay if you want to be sort of close to times square i never really liked this location bed was very comfortable aveda products are great the cons the kitchen and bathrooms are a little old they made me feel like i was in a recent college graduates apartment if fact they reminded me of my first place in manhattan the airconditioners are window acs so much of the noise and air from the street come into the room the tvs are old and reception of channels wasnt great internet was not free even in the business center not a luxurious stay but again great for families,Positive
i stayed at the affinia this past friday night and i will never ever go back although it is relatively inexpensive i have to say ive stayed at better for the same price in nyc the place is severely in need of a remodel the hallways smelled and periodically you would see white dust all over the floor where i guess sheetrock got bumped by something i saw the same patches for two days so evidently no one bothered to clean it up the rooms are alright not much better than a holiday inn they have some quotorder your own pillowquot thing that i didnt partake in so i cant speak to that the beds themselves are uncomfortable and probably the worst night of sleep ive had in a while we had coffee provided in our room but no coffee maker the front desk checkin people were friendly but the woman who works at the concierge desk had an attitude and a halfthere was no quotdo not disturbquot sign in the room so we were awoken at am am am and am despite asking the woman to come back after checkout time i called the front desk to ask for a late checkout and was told that the hotel was all booked i assured the woman i wasnt trying to overstay my welcome but under the circumstances being awoken times by housekeeping i didnt think it was unreasonable for them to provide an extra hourespecially since there was no sign to keep housekeeping away i was told i shouldve ordered a sign from the front desk when i noticed it was missing to which i responded quoti didnt notice it was missing until i was woken up for the second time and i didnt realize they would come back four times i wouldve had to answer the door for housekeeping yet again in order to accept the sign anywayquot her tone of voice was very condescending and arrogant when i thanked her and told her i would be writing a lovely review for the hotel on tripadvisor she then offered her manager i hung up deciding this place and its employees were not worth my time all in all its a cheap place to stay but its so cheap it doesnt even deserve the three stars it has it would be more accurate to give this place two stars unless they do some renovating you can find boutique places that are just as inexpensive but that have some character at the very least theyll be clean do not be fooled by the pictures of the hotel on their website i would not recommend this place,Positive
it was our first time in ny and stayed at the affinia we were not dissapointed what a fantastic location the hotel was clean comfortable the staff were great it was a bit noisy but thats new york for you cant wait to go back wow,Positive
i needed a place for my family to stay during mothers day weekend and we couldnt have picked a better hotel from the moment we arrived until we were walking out the door at the end of the weekend every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful most of them even remembered our names i was so pleased with the room location service and value that ive since recommended it to many of my friends and will continue to do so over and over again,Positive
to be fair i thought this was a good hotel room for the price i paid night on travelzoo my biggest complaint is that their website misrepresents the hotel it is not as lavish and upscale as it is on the website the rooms are huge for manhattan with a little kitchen and plenty of walking space but everything was really old the bathroom needed to be retiled and regrouted and it was an old tv the location is also good if youre looking for midmanhattan and close to the trains,Positive
i chose this hotel because my stay was short and its across from penn station with easy access to ewr via nj transit i stayed at the affinia in chicago which was newly remodeled and considerably nicer than this one as i was walking up to the room i distinctly felt like i was in a holiday inn from the s what a flashback the price reflected this though and it was kind of shabby but the basic kitchen facility was great since i love fixing my own bfast with stuff i buy at whole foods i wouldnt recommend this hotel for a special nyc experience but for a purely functional source of basic lodging it worked for me,Positive
we loved the affinia manhattan the rooms were huge bed was comfy location was perfect staff were friendly we booked through travelzoo and got an amazing rate of night at that price it was more than i expected yes the rooms are older but they are huge compared to other nyc hotels it was more like your own apartment we were on the th floor so no street noise other than an occasional siren i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great deal on a budget,Positive
we went to nyc for my wifes th birthday and we stayed at the hotel for nights in april got there just before pm and checked in straight away with out a wait asked for a room high on a corner via mail previously and got a great room with a view of the empire state building the staff were very helpful and courteous throughout the room was clean tidy and even had a balcony area which was an exception but a great addition the temp got quite high over the weekend we stayed and miraculously a tablechairs and brolly appeared on the balcony so we took advantage of the opportunity to have a glass of wine or two whilst enjoying the view spent some time at the niles barrestaurant next door which was ok for some refreshment after ambling back from some sight seeing there is a fire station and police station close by so you do hear the sirens during the night but we had no real problems sleeping other than problems caused by the time differencewe only ate breakfast there and it was good but a bit pricey saw as much as we had aimed to seeempire state central park rockafeller centre times square lincoln centre couple of museums and a bit of shopping etc all great and thoroughly enjoyable and all with in walking distance of the hotel i would stay there again and explore more of the south of the city next time but overall very good and would recommend the hotel also would recommend the rockafeller centre over the esb not least because the esb is part of the view,Positive
we stayed at affinia manhattan for nights at the end of marchstart of april we actually only stayed nights as our first night we were delayed in la and didnt make it to ny till the next day the hotel was exactly what we were expecting grand lobby dated rooms but nice and clean and a decent location for sightseeing for a first time visitor we had a studio room room on the th floor which was at the end of a corridor so no neighbours on one side room was large one queen bed desk and chair arm chair dated kitchen and a tiny but completely serviceable bathroom with fantastic water pressure in the shower room was very clean and kept clean during our staywe found the staff to all be very friendly and extremely helpful whenever you needed them we ate at niles restaurant one night and really enjoyed our meal and drinks we ate up at the bar farly early one night pretheatre food was good and was reasonably priced for a hotel restauranton the whole affinia manhattan was what we were expecting and for a great price from travelzoo weekend weeknights it was one of four nyc hotels we stayed in and even though it was older style it still measured up against more pricey accommodations in the thompson groupwe would definitely reccommend it to anyone if you can get a good price like we did,Positive
while i was in new york for a brief conference i decided to actually stay at the hotel where most of the events were being held this was a change for me usually ill stay elsewhere and just make my way to the hotel i dont have a problem with the subway and in fact typically enjoy it but since the rate at the affinia was one of the better ones i decided that it would be easier to just stay therein general im glad that i did but you need to take it with a grain of salt and be ready for what youll get when you check in make sure that you realize that this is an older property and youll probably be okay with what you get when you arrive in your roomnotably the rooms are reasonably well upholstered but they are on the small side and the plaster is aging so you will see some cracks and some of them might be on the large side you arent going to see central air and in fact you wont see a thermostat of any kindinstead you get what is essentially a steamcontrolled radiator to handle the heat that is expelled into the room youll also have a window unit air conditioner for cooling the room but in the winter these units are taped shut to keep cold air from coming into the room so hope that you dont hit a hot spell or youll have to open the window to cool things downfinally you may want to make sure that you dont get a quotquot room etc this is because the main steam pipe runs through the closet and it makes the room absolutely bake even opening the outside window with outside temperatures in the s kept the room a nice degrees so it was bearable but it meant that the outside noise increased quite a bit and even when closed those windows dont block a lot of noise,Positive
we stayed at this hotel for nights and got a great rate through travelzoo the hotel was in great location close to everything eg penn station and macys are only a block awaythe staff was really welcoming and friendly and the check in process took less than minutes our room was on the th floor with a views of the th avenue the room was huge with two ultracomfortable queen size beds there was a small kitchen with a stove big refrigerator a microwave a toaster and a coffeemakerthe bathroom was nice and clean and the shower had a good water pressure everyone keeps complaining about the size of the bathrooms but i think it was fine i didnt hit my elbows to the walls or get tangled with the shower curtain so the size of the bathroom was ok besides you dont go to new york to spend all your time in the hotel room bathroom anywaythere was also an electric safe in the room an ironing board a clockradio and a tv with about channelson our day of departure we took a black car lincoln towncar from the hotel to jfk it only cost incl toll and gratuity and was a lot more comfortable than a regular cabwe recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to new york city its in perfect location beautiful comfortable clean and safe and with the friendliest staff well definitely return to this hotel the next time we visit new york,Positive
could you ask for a better location across the road from madison square garden and penn station the affinia manhattan is a great value accommodation option for the sophisticated traveller looking for a budget level below star our room was large clean and well appointed with separate bedroom and full kitchen which made it perfect for us traveling with three small kids sure the noise from th avenue reaches the room the new york lullaby as we called it but this is manhattan if you wanted quiet you would have gone to vermont right staff were great sharp and helpful and the concierge desk was staffed by real pros well be back again and again,Positive
my husband and i stayed at the affinia manhattan on celebrating our wedding anniversary we booked through travelticker and got a great average rate of for a studio with a king size bed we arrived at jfk and took the airtrain to jamaica and the lirr to penn station and were in the hotel in no time and it was very cheap checkin was quick and the staff was very friendly and helpful we got a really nice room on the th floor with a balcony overlooking penn stationmsg the room was spotless it had a nice sized closet with plenty of room for clothes and shopping bags with an iron and ironboard and safety box the room also had a working desk with an office chair plus another arm chair there was also a drawer dresser nightstands and a kitchenette with microwave stove and a small fridge the location cant be beat just across from penn station so we used the subway every day macys and th street shopping is only blocks away and times sqaure only one subway station away we would definitely go back and we would recommend it to others,Positive
we stayed here for night following the yankee stadium quotnight of hopequot event with pastor joel osteen and i must say i approve the bedroom suite was great and the having two full bathrooms was a perk my little quotdivosquot didnt have to fight about who got in the restroom first the location provided a little extra background noise from the emergency responder vehicles but we live in the city so we are use to it the staff was great our limo broke down blocks from the hotel so i called and they had our room ready when we arrived hour early i appriciated the extra security that was avaliable at night they only allowed guests who had a key card past the elevators duncan donuts is in the same block so that was helpful for the morning breakfast rush at a good price time square was about or blocks and the subway access is great i will stay here again and again,Positive
we booked on a great rate through travelzoo so we didnt expect too much we wanted a suite so our girls and would have their own space for this family weekend trip to nyc we were able to checkin early around and were given a suite on the th floor the suite had a pullout sofa bed that the kids found comfortable bathrooms a king bed in the bedroom and a small kitchen with a fullsized refrigerator microwave stove etc the concierge desk had a dedicated computer and printer for printing boarding passes for your trip home the bell hops were helpful and courteous wireless internet was available for per day but we didnt use it we also didnt really explore the other facilities at the hotel they will bring you complimentary travelsized toiletries if you askthe location was great if a little noisy we were walking distance to chelsea times square madison square park theater district etc and right across the street from penn station and msgi would recommend this hotel highly for anyone looking for a little more space in a manhattan hotel,Positive
we stayed here twice in march myself hubbie and two kids aged and it is in a fantastic location on th avenue accross from maddison square gardens and penn station a few blocks from macys and times square etc it is smack bang in the middle of manhatten a great base to explore from the lobby is lovely and the reception staff very welcoming and informative there is a restaurant attached to the hotel and we had a most fantastic meal here at a very good price the kitchen is very handy for breakfast in the morning the fridge is huge and would not be out of place in a full family kitchen plenty of room for food juicesor wine or beers the bedrooms are very big a bit dated but the beds are very very comfortable as are the pillows i can put up with decor that is a bit dull when comfort and crisp linen is part of the deal the rooms were made up each day maybe one day was missed cant remember now and there was a change of towels every day too we stayed in a studio suite first which had two queen beds when we returned to manhatten we booked the one bedroomed suite we had a seperate bedroom and the kids slept on a convertable sofa bed we had two bathrooms with the one bedroom and two showers which is a bonus so i would definitly reccmmend that if adults were booking in here but for families with our aged children then the studio suite was more than ok the air conditioning is attached to the windows so those windows did not leave in much light i guess the rooms were quite dark really and the lights needed to be left on during the day now if i was spending a lot of time in the hotel during the day it would really bug me ii would return here for the comfortable beds amp pillows the clean white linen the brilliant location the nice staff and the very good value for money for a manhatten hotel,Positive
the location of this hotel is excellent macys one block away across the street from penn station and two blocks from different subway stations i arrived at the hotel at am and my hotel room was ready i prefered a room on a higher floor so i would not have to hear the nyc traffic but i had to manage with one on the th floor noise level was not bad at all although i did not have a view we spent most of the time outside of the room anyway so it was fine the room was very clean and was a nice size for nyc standards comfortable bed too id definately stay there again the staff was very helpful as well,Positive
other reviewers are correct when they say that the lobby is far nicer than the actual rooms ive really never seen such a contrast its almost like theyre implicitly saying that they only need your business oncei dont get too hung up on perfection in a room so the shabby floor was fine by me it was clean as was the rest of the room the air conditioner was a piece of garbage its hard to imagine it working well in the summer it was basically a vent to the outside world so i felt fortunate to be in this room on a nice spring evening not too hot not too coldfor some reason i was put in a room directly across from the elevators this was clearly a handicappedaccessible room i wasnt too happy with this the hotel didnt appear to be anywhere near full so id think a room by the elevators would be a last resort i was worried about foot traffic keeping me awake but it ended up not being an issue at allon the th floor i could still hear the street noise as if i was on the st again the ac unit was basically a hole in the window being across from madison square garden on the night of a rangers playoff game made me nervous about getting a good nights sleep as did the incessant cab honking but around it all died down and i was able to sleep just fineall in all i expected to have a lot of trouble sleeping but ended up getting plenty of rest without a problem the hotel is not sparkling new but it is clean still i think for the money one could do better nearby either with a nicer room for the same price or a cheaper room thats equally as nice or not as one in the affinia,Positive
we arrived at the hotel at around the doorman was initially unsure to whether we the room would be ready luckily it was we were checked in by the pleasant staff surprisingly quickly our room was on the th floor and it was spotless the room was large however the bathroom was as everyone has already said on the small side but it was fine however the bath could have done with a good scrub because it looked a little worn but i was just amazed at having a bath every day we got fresh towels and toiletries as well as the bed being made everydaythe location was so great and everything was so accesible macys was a two minute walk down the street and madison square garden and penn station were opposite the actual hotel also access to the subway was great as there are two stops that we used a lot within five minutes walking distance we only got a cab from the airport and never in the city the subway is not as threatening and uncomfortable as i thought it would be so we used it all the time it was amazingly cheap too i loved the fact that even after one day the area of the hotel felt familiar and unthreatening even when we wandered home at five in the morning the area was still a little busy with people and there was still a doorman to welcome us backthe conceirge dont think ive spelt that right service was good too we only used it once to organise a tour and they also cashed my travellers cheques with them with no hassle we ate at niles the restaurant next to the hotel for breakfast and it was one of the best meals we had in new york it was tasty reasonably priced with a quick service and proper dining experience it was also busy in the evenings and after pm when everyone had finished work we would also recommend that you go to some of the local irish pubs i had one of the best nights out ever in new yorkthe room was high up and towards the back of the hotel so our view was of a water tank and some other buildings so nothing special but there was little noise apart from the occasional fire engine siren but nothing major we were also situated next to the service elevator which would bother some i guess but it didnt bother me or my friend at all also whilst we loved the fact that we got to watch american tv the actual connection could be lost for hours if we went through it too quickly so we basically stuck with mtv all in all we could not have asked for a better hotel i know there have been some negative reviews regarding that it is quite dated but we really liked that it felt homely and it was such a good place to unwind and chill out when i go back to new york i would absolutely have to stay at this hotel again it was simply great,Positive
my friend and i stayed in the affinia for a day shopping break the location is amazing mins from time square and th avenue and with the subway across the road getting around was really easy when we first arrived we were given a standard room which had one bed in seeing as there was two of us this was not a great start the hotel blamed the agent that booked the room so we went to see it and it was a shoe box the room had a double bed and a tv on the wall that was it we decided to upgrade which we had to pay for ourselves despite a heated debate with the check in staff but they would not budge it cost us to upgrade to a suite which had two queen beds and a kitchen this room was fab loads of storage space a huge kitchen and a small living area everything we would have expectedaccept for the bathroom which is probably the size of a caravan bathroom i have never seen anything so small but it did what it needed to do whilst being very amuzing we had a view straight out onto madison sq gardens and yes it was a little noisey but we were floors up and by the time we got back to the room we were to tired or drunk to care niles bar is nice and conveniant but expensive harringtons bar across the road is a great irish bar and has better prices but with time square just down the road you really are spoilt for choice this hotel has is perfectly placed for everything you could need just make sure you get the right room first time,Positive
first time in new york and delighted that we chose the affinia manhattan having seen the price of hotels in new york high we were very happy to have booked direct with the hotel during their day sale and got an excellent price our room on the th floor was excellent we had two large beds a big lounge area with full sized sofa proper dining room table and a large kitchen area the kitchen included a full sized cooker and fridgefreezer and microwave plus all the pots and pans crockery etc that you might need in addition there was a good modern coffee maker with fresh coffee and tea being replenished daily the closet was a good size and contained an iron and ironing board and an all important safety deposit box inside the closet the bathroom had a bath tub and overhead shower and contained a hairdryer the room was kept spotlessly clean by the maid service and we found all the staff helpful and courteous if people want to be picky the bathroom was rather small but as mentioned it was always kept clean with towels being changed daily along with replenished good quality toiletries the hotel is ideally situated in the heart of manhattan and opposite penn station even though new york is a hour city with heavy traffic constant sirens we found the room to be a haven and the noise never kept us awake must have been all that walking hope to return to new york in the not too distant future and the affinia manhattan will be our first choice great hotel and could not fault it,Positive
i dont think that you can beat this hotel for location and service its right accross the road from madison square garden the empire state building is only blocks away as is macys everywhere else is in easy reach as your right in the middle of the city weve stayed here times and each time weve been impressed with the rooms theyre huge and have everything you could need yes some of the decoration or furniture is looking a bit tired but i dont go to new york to stay in the room and gaze at the furniture the rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable just what you need after a hard day shopping and sightseeingtry mustang harrys accross the street amp one block down great food atmosphere and service at really reasonable prices try the restaurantbar nextdoor to the hotel for breakfast its also great for a cocktailswe found all the hotel staff to be really friendly and helpful be sure to ask they have a room with a terrace available great views of the downtown skyline,Positive
lovely hotel and very central when visiting nyc for the first time we are women in our early s our room was on the th floor and at teh side of the hotel so there was no traffic noise we booked a room with two double beds and were unsure if it would be as we expected the room had two double beds which were extremely comfortable a smallish bathroom and a small kitchen with coffee maker oven fridge and accessories the staff were very pleasant and helpful and tehre was always a alovely atmosphere around the hotel,Positive
spent a week at this hotel for my th birthday great location large impressive rooms lovely to be able to do cups of tea in room amp use the fridge bed very comfy staff friendly generally a very good hotel only downside was finding a cockroach on my kitchen floor when we got back night they eventually removed it for me they didnt seem very surprised or shocked amp gave us a free brunch at niles next door and a can of cockroach spray use supermarket in penn station for milkwater and eat at mustang sallys great american experience turn left as u come out of hotel walk mins and cross the road,Positive
we are a family of and had suites very clean comfortable and spacious for us all extremely comfortable beds and lovely fresh white bedding its a shame bathrooms didnt match standard very tired looking needed redoing we requested high level rooms with views if poss we were very happy that we had brilliant views on the th floor shame about the dirty windows but i suppose this is new york all through our stay we found the staff extremely helpful and friendly we were happy with location as this hotel is very central mins times sq mins empire state mins maceys opp maddison sq gardens and penn station we walked just about everywhere overall we were very happy with this hotel it was good value for money would definately recommend it we booked our trip for nights but would reccomend nights so much to see,Positive
my kids and i stayed here last summer for six nights sense none of us had been to manhattan before it was very nerve racking to pick a hotel after researching like crazy thanks to trip advisor i finally picked the affinia manhattan it was wonderful the best vacation we had ever been on all of the staff was great our room were always clean i couldnt have picked a better place we stayed in one of the rooms with a terrace it was truly amazing a wonderful place to sit in the mornings and evenings and such a view i am hoping to go back next fall and will stay in the same room if possible great place to stay,Positive
we are a family of ten most of us in new york for the first time we arrived at the hotel at about in the afternoon we had booked four rooms we got two rooms right away then my daughter husband and two children were told there was only one bed in their room no bed for the children which we had already paid for the girl on the desk said they had no more rooms after we asked to speak to the manager they suddenly found a family room my husband and i were told we would have to wait two hours for a room when we eventually got it it had not been cleaned before we left for the holiday i emailed the hotel and asked for rooms on a high floor with good views my room had a blacked out window and was on the lowest floornow for the good points the rooms were spaciousvery clean with lovely comfortable beds with nice bedding the shower was also goodwe did get compensated for our problems when we arrivedthey gave us a free breakfast a bottle of wine and fruit so it all turned out ok in the end,Positive
we booked the affinia hotel as we got a good price for the hotel and flights and we thought it was in a very good location it was easy to walk everywhere from our hotel prior to going we had emailed them and asked if we could have a high floor room facing the empire state building to which them replyed they would do their best when we landed in jfk we got a bus to our hotel from new york airport service which we had booked online before going it cost two of us for both of us return when we arrived it looked very nice on the outside checking in was fast and easy and we were greeted by loverly staff they told us our room number which was on teh th floor when we got in the room room we were pleased to find a kitchen and a terracethe bathroom was a little small but we it was really clean and good for what we needed our bed was really big and room was a nice size it was not very quiet in the sense that whatever time in the day you alwaysheard noise whether it was fire engines as there was a fire station near our hotel cars this was not a fault of the hotel i am sure you will hear this is any hotel as all of new york is busy anything we needed for the duration of our stay was no problem for any of the staff it took approx mins to walk to time square from our hotel maddison square gardens is oppisite our hotel and macys is about a min walk when seeing down town ground zero statue of liberty etc we got a subway from opppisite our hotel saw the sites then walked back to our hotel i think it is about miles but it was deffo worth it as we were able to see the financial district china town and little italy we were also reccomended a steak restaurant called ben bensons steak house which is on nd st between th and th avenue check with your hotel on that one but i am sure thats rights we had the best steak we had ever eaten there the meal came to which is about although it is expensive the meal or teh service could not be faulted and its not everyday you are in new york other places that we ate included hard rock cafe planet hollywoord ruby tuesday which are all in time square on the main street we did not have a bad meal in new york and our eveing meal usually cost approx for two of us that includes a tip which most restaurants added on we also found some nice delis for our dinner one was called the stage deli which is a bit further up form rockafeller centre on th avenue we had the biggest sandwich ever we went up rockafellor centre at night and did empire centre in the daytime which was good when we went to see groud zero we visited the museam which is next door to the fire station i would reccomend anyone to visit this it was fantastic as for the shows we went to see lion king which was out of this world it was worth every penny and the costumes were loverly we had a brilliant trip to new york and thought the hotel helped to make the holiday extra special when you go try tootsie rolls which is like a chocolate toffee and butter fingers which is a chocolate bar filled with crisp layers of peanut butter delish,Positive
stayed five nights at affinia mathattan a group of eight of us in three roomslocation of hotel is perfect right in the centre of things within five minutes walking distance of macys e s b times sqour rooms were on different floors all clean spaciousniles bar on ground floor is friendly staff very helpfull giving advice on getting around new york harringtons across the road from hotel serves good food at a reasonable price and there is a deli beside hotel alsowe used gray line tour bus great way to get around hop on hop off as you want to the different staff on these buses all had there own views on manhattan making in very interesting everyone wants to sit on top so its very much pot luck when waitingif your into photography try to get nelsons bus as the guide who name escapes me sets up some great shotswhen planing your day take into account airport type security at attractions and allow time for sameeg one hour for us at ellis island ferry taxi from j f k costs includind tolls and tips there are other options train is cheapest take airtrain to jamacia then on to penn station oppsite hotel,Positive
we booked the affinia manhattan through virgin holidays as it worked out much cheaper than booking flights and hotels separatelywe wasnt sure what to expect given a few mixed reviews on here but for the money it seemed ok so went ahead and booked itthe virgin atlantic flights from heathrow were good we checked in online and printed our own boarding passes so all that had to be done was to drop off the bags on arrival at twe hadnt booked transfers so we opted for a taxi the virgin holidays rep greeted us and pointed us in the direction of the official taxis they are a flat rate to anywhere in manhattan plus toll and plus tip so it was about there are cheaper ways but this was nice and convenientcheck in at the hotel was quick no problems there we had requested a high room we got one on the th floor it also had a little balcony which was nice though we didnt really use it much as we were always on the go the room was big weve not stopped in nyc before so cant compare it to others but it was big compared to other cities the only downside was that the bathroom was very small wed happily have given up some of the kitchen area for a larger bathroom the room itself is a little dated and tired but not too bad the bed was comfy and the sheets towels etc were all ok and clean i guess that if the room was thoroughly modern the price would probably be double given the locationits location is really good especially for the first time visitor it is right opposite msgpenn station if you come out of the exit next to niles youre right on th avenue so time sq is an easy walk straight down th there is a starbucks over the road and a couple of bars we went into harringtons a few times which is just over the road we watched a knicks game in there one night as the tickets at msg were a little on the expensive side if you want to watch a game id recommend buying your tickets well in advance macys is close by also should you want to go shopping we walked almost everywhere including all the way down to battery park for the staten island ferry and then on to the brooklyn bridgeif possible id recommend you go to time square during the week as when we when on the weekend it was heaving we also enjoyed going to central park it was nice walking around there and a world away from the bustling streets only a few minutes away getting around is easy due to the way the streets are there are always loads of taxis about also should you need one just make sure you have the address readywe had some excellent food while we were there notably maze by gordon ramsay the spotted pig amongst otherswe found beer and wine quite expensive in nyc im sure there were cheaper places but generally you are looking at for a beer pint and for a glass of wine though the food always seemed good value for moneyin summary we enjoyed our five night stay in nyc the affinia manhattan gave us a hotel with a good base for exploring the city at a good price given you probably wont spend much time in the room the bits that count were good ie the comfy bed clean bedding etc,Positive
great location but the room we had was shabby expected better from a hotel the public areas are great you just get a bit let down when you get to your room,Positive
we were in town for an event at madison square garden we arrived by train we chose the hotel based on location it was perfect right across the street from madison square garden and penn station so convenient but also centrally located to head off exploring in all directions based on low price we were not sure what to expect but were pleasantly surprised the staff was exceptional rooms were neat clean and surprisingly large for nyc we could not ask for more would definately stay here again,Positive
i am really glad that i chose to stay at the affinia manhattanas recommonded by other trip advisor reviewers when we arrived we were checked in straight away and taken to our room on the th floor i was travelling with my mum and knew that we had only booked a queen bed but the very helpful and friendly receptionist said that he could change us to a double queen room the night later at no extra cost but there wasnt one available that night this was a bonus as we didnt expect thisthe first room was medium sized with a kitchenette clean and had a view of the tip of the empire state building the only down side was the bathroom was really small not really a problem but it was in need of abit of a revamp and wasnt spotlessly clean otherwise we were happy with the roomthe next day we went to see the same gentleman who had checked us in and took our safe items to be put in the reception safe this is very safe as both staff and yourself need keys to access it while the hotel staff arranged for our bags to be moved to our new roomsaving us alot of time and energyafter a long day in the city we came back to collect our key to the new room on the th floorand we were blown away it was double the size queen beds a modern larger bathroom bright kitchenette and a huge balcony dont think that many have balconys either it didnt have the view of the empire state building but this did not matter in the slightest the noise in the nd room being on a higher floor and at the rear of the hotel was similar to the st roomyou hear policefire engines and taxi horns in new york all the time so you get used to it and doesnt disturb your sleepalso the beds are the comfiest we have ever slept in and this really counts when you have a busy day in manhattanoverall i would definately recommend this hotel especially for the locationround the corner from the empire state and macys mins and about mins walk to times square absolutely brilliant oh and for a fab breakfast diner go to andrews which is on th avenue on about th streetturn right outside the hotel and youll walk upto it on your rightthey do a great variety of food at reasonable prices and the staff are great,Positive
we had a fantastic time in new york our year old son loved it and loved the gorilla the hotel left on the bed ok you had to pay for him but it was a cute ideahotel is in a good central location easy to walk to loads of sites and shopping in macys sephora and old navy to mention a fewlovely little greek cafe across the road and a minute walk restaurantbar niles was nice as wellwe got a deal on lastminute half the price of the hotel website we got a inside room near the lifts but it was not a problem and we all slept like logs in a lovely quiet warm clean room the little kitchenette was great for grabbing some toast and coffee and getting going early we were at the top of the empire state building at amthe tenement museum in the lower east side is definitely worth a trip really interesting and we loved the polar bear in the small zoo in central park he looked like he was having a lot of funnot a cheap holiday but new york is a great place for a visit whatever your interests or age,Positive
the location of the hotel is very good its on th avenue and nd street right opposite maddison sq garden and penn stationwhen we arrived at the hotel we got there a little before the check in time and our room was not ready but they were able to store our luggage and we went for a walk while we waited for the roomthe location of the hotel is very close to maceys and the empire state building while walk minutes more towards the direction central park and you are at times square we were able to walk most places though we did take the subway when we went to see the statue of libertyif you would rather not pay for the privilege of getting a boat to the statue of liberty then take the statten island ferry this will take you to statten island and back and is free you will need to zoom in to take a photo of the statue though but you get a great view of the docks and city landscapei wasnt greatly impressed with the room mine was on the th floor but was still noisy from the noise of the city traffic the room was very warm and even though i turned the radiators right down that didnt seem to make any difference while the bathroom is the smallest i have ever seenthe cooking area was very useful though and the fridge was very good needed a kettle really though i just used the microwave to boil water for drinks the coffee maker took ages and the water still wasnt hoti really liked new york there is lots to see and do if you have children take them to toys r us in times sq and have a go on the ferris wheel there is also an animatronic t rex which is very impressive while my wife loved the shops on th avenue well mostly just the shop windows personally i loved going up the rockafeller centre and seeing the city landscape and the empire state buildingwe also went ice skating in central park which i recommendi think new york has something for everyone and i would go again i just wouldnt choose this hotel though the hotel staff are great especially the bell boys,Positive
we asked for rooms on the higher floors and got on floor and on floor both were large beautifully fitted out and had a separate kitchen and bathroom the real bonus was the balcony on the th floor room maybe we got it because it was my birthday but what a plus no breakfast room so we took the bell boys advice and turned right out of the hotel and down the street just opposite st franciss church theres a great little diner which seems to be frequented by nypd so must be good id certainly recommend the fluffy pancakes with bacon and maple syrup we had a great stay here the front desk staff were able to make restaurant reservations for us and you can check in for your flight online free at reception and get your printout the sirens from the trucks leaving the adjacent fire station seem to go off all night but i had no problem sleeping throught them and actually i loved it all part of city life the location is great if youre heading off to a broadway show within easy walking distance and of course directly opposite madison square garden and penn station subway line but best of all were the rooms luxurious clean and a great place to flop after a days sightseeing,Positive
my wife and i stayed at the affinia in march for nights personally i am no hotel snob and therefore my review is an honest piece which highlights exactly what this hotel is location wise its absolutely brilliant opposite msg and therefore a subway station times square is a minute walk and once there other tourist venues all become apparent the hotel itself was in my humble opinion faultless the staff from arrival to departure were all brilliantmaureen on the customer service desk was particularly helpful the room was perfect for a short stay a large comfortable bed and yes the bathroom is small but seriously who cares unless your trying to squeeze a family of elephants in there then it wont be a problem i missed not having a bath especially after miles of walking daily but the shower was hot and welcoming in the evenings and mornings on the first night the radiators were making an intermittent clunking noise but all that needed doing was turning them down and fault fixedwe didnt need them anyway as the room was warm enough room service was ordered one night and came within mins rooms were cleaned on request and the tv had decent channels to fall asleep to in the evenings heck we even had a room that looked out to the empire state at no extra costif your looking for value for money excellent location with the addition of friendly staff then look no further i would definitely go back to new york and i would also stay at the affinia again,Positive
myself and two friends stayed here for four nights and the hotel was perfect we had a room with a kitchen inc fridge oven microwave toaster coffee machine no kettle but we boiled water on the hob for our tea sofabed tv we had another tv in the bedroom with two big comfy beds and if that wasnt good enough we had two bathroomswe had breakfast every morning at the bagel mavern right across the street then we could walk straight penn station and the subway as they were right up the streetthere are plenty of restaurantstakeawaysgrocery stores within one block of the hotel the area was quite noisy at night but what do you expect in the centre of new york nothing earplugs wont fix the concierge were really helpful and recommended restaurants to visit and booked us reservations and we couldnt fault the foodi highly recommend renting a bike and cycling around the central park mile loop it was a beautiful way to see it all in all this hotel was great with good sized clean rooms and helpful staff we had no problems and would defintely stay here again,Positive
from the moment i made reservations with a terrific rate from travel zoo i felt special by the amenities that were offered to me online when i checked into the hotel the front desk was professional cheerful and friendly and the room was incredibly spacious and comfortable we found the concierge desk to be a great resource dined at the lugo cafe nearby upon their recommendation and i loved the boarding pass printout station at the concierge desk i highly recommend this hotel for its location and its thoughtful guest services as well as the spacious rooms and gracious staff,Positive
this is an older but clean and elegant hotel our extended family booked three rooms for one night only and loved that its across from madison square garden close to time square and all the hubbub of new york surprisingly our rooms were quiet and the staff courteous and helpful our teens and younger kids liked the spaciousness of the rooms,Positive
great location very large rooms for new york clean and frendly good value for money best of all the pillowstinafrom london,Positive
we had a studio suite with a queen bed it was a huge room with the bed way at one end and the desk at the other there was plenty of space for there to be a couch and coffee table but instead it was just large empty space which was fine but the bathroom was comically small probably the smallest shower ive ever seen in my life if they were to remodel it would make sense to take up some empty space in the main room and use it to build a shower and bathroom that a normal human could use if theyre going for the smurf market they have it downeverything else was great location was excellent got a great deal from expedia staff was friendly and helpful wed stay there again,Positive
i stayed at the affinia manhattan one night in march as i do annually great location very nice staff th floor room small view of top of the empire state building other than that not a great viewi have had better experiences at the affinia cons inroom internet access did not work despite repeated phone discussions with technical service cable tv reception terriblesmallest hotel shower everbilling and check in issues central reservation systems had not placed our reservations into the onsite system hotel overcharged our group for additional nights we had to resend confirmations we received from the hotel prior to checkinproslocation madison square garden and penn stationoverall room size for nychotel rooms and i believe public areas are undergoing a major renovation beginning in may which is good the place could use some sprucing up,Positive
i visited nyc for my th birthday with my mum neither of us had been to new york before and due to price and other reviews on trip advisor we decided on this place as our base we arrived after an early morning flight from uk and dumped our bags in our room it was huge and had good quality furniturefittings although could probabally do with updating sometime soon but it was clean and well presented it was quite noisy at night as other people mention but you are visiting a hour city so what do you expectit doesnt keep you awake though as you are so tired from all the walkingit was brilliantly placed for us on th ave so very central and safe it is a couple of minutes walk to macys which we often called into on our way back home for the nightnear to the empire statepenn stationmadison square gardenscentral park etc and the rest of the tourist attractions are further away but spaced out so you cant be near them all useful tourist info stand in lobby which were helpful in sorting out the usual tourist thingsshow on broadwaybus tour etcsmall but fully stocked shop next door that sells everything you could want to eatplenty of fresh breadmilk drinks snacks etc which is useful as the room has self catering aspect you will never go hungry or thirsty though as there as starbucks every yards and i am not kidding brilliantly equipped kitchenette we didnt want to splash out on fancy restaurants we were there to visit the tourist attractions and shop so saved a fortune by eating in most evenings although would recommend gordon ramseys restaurant the london for a treat,Positive
id have to say reading the reviews on this hotel started me off with a bad outlook on staying at affinia manhattan when i arrived to the hotel it was in a great location and the staff was very helpful once i got their attention the lobby is beautiful with a very modern barrestaurant connected the parking is outrageously expensive butit is new york city i called ahead and spoke with an employee who changed my room as i requested one with a decent view when i arrived the room was massive and very clean the beds are comfortable but the sheets leave a little to be desired the staff accomodated every request i had and went above and beyond what i asked over all great place to stay if you arent incredibly picky,Positive
several girlfriends and i stayed at the affinia manhattan february march and could not have been happier i booked my reservation through travelzoo and got an unbelievable deal per night our one bedroom suite had full bathrooms which is quite unusual in manhattan the beds were very comfortable and the kitchen efficiency came in quite handy the concierge was more than helpful giving great restaurant tips and easytofollow directions the hotel is older and hasnt had many updates but the lobby is beautiful checkin was a breeze the affinia manhattan is directly across the street from madison square garden and blocks away from fantastic shopping also the hotel restaurant is great with friendly knowledgable bartenders especially jamie,Positive
we stayed here for nights staying in a bed suite it was really spacious and clean hotel is really central to everything and only blocks from macys shopping heaven directly opposite madison square garden we found this hotel excellent value and will definitely be coming back again,Positive
loved the location incredibly accomodating staff i have been staying at the affinia for years as far back as when it was the southgate tower and it only gets better ten blocks south of times square not quite as crazy directly across from penn station two blocks from herald square the location couldnt be better my family met for a weekend in the city all of us arriving way too early for check in but affinia found a room and checked us in at am the concierge service is excellent my twenty three year old son and his girlfriend would call the service from all parts of the city to ask advice the studios are actually nicer than the one bedroom suites more spacious and with better views but both have great kitchens which come in so handy for breakfast or late night snacks,Positive
we stayed at the affinia for days and could not fing any fault the rooms was huge and the bed really comfy staff are friendly and helpful the conceriege service was suburb offering great advice and recommendationsthe hotel is in a great position nice and central,Positive
we stayed at this hotel because we got a fabulous deal through one of their occasional sales although we had a very pleasant stay i doubt we would stay here at full price because it is easy to find cheaper rooms in a quieter neighborhoodour train arrived at penn station midmorning this hotel is almost across the street from the station and it is quite nice to be able to walk right to your hotel rather than wait for a cab it was also great to have this location on our last day because it meant we could have a full day of fun before our pm train without having to factor in time to retrieve our bags from a distant hotel we went to brooklyn on our last day so this was especially appreciatedwe arrived at the hotel expecting to stow our bags instead we got a room right away the exact type of room we had requested wasnt available yet but they offered us a choice of a couple of rooms that were ready which i thought was great service we chose a room with two beds on the th floor when i saw the room we were given i contacted the desk to verify the price the room was big and i mean that by any hotel standard not just nyc standards so big that i felt the need to make sure i would have no surprises at checkout besides the two beds the room had a full couch desk dresser and ottoman there was no table which we thought was odd since there certainly was room for one and the room had a full kitchenthe appliances in the kitchen with the exception of the microwave were definitely old there was even some rust on the refrigerator but everything was in working condition and very clean so no complaints and when was the last time you had a hotel room with an actual oven there were some pots pans and utensils but not an entire array for example there was no colander although i would think that pasta would be a pretty common quick dinner on the roadthe beds were comfortable and the bathroom was roomy and clean with good amenities my main complaint was the difficulty in moderating the temperature in the room the room was quite warm and we could only turn the temperature down slightly however we have several friends who live in older high rises in the city and this is a common problem so im not sure if theres much the hotel could do short of a major overhaul the furnishings and decor were not particularly fancy this is definitley an older building but everything was cleanthe staff were all friendly and courteous my son got a bad rash while we were there and the staff quickly pointed us to a pharmacy that could help us they also quickly pointed us to delis grocery stores and other common needs that can be difficult to find in this neighborhood the concierge seemed to be helping a lot of people to get tickets to shows the concierge staff didnt seem to have as much knowledge of the best ways to get to some of the farflung sites we were trying to get to but most people likely stay in this neighborhood for shows shopping and the more standard tourist sites so the concierge service is likely more than adequate for most guests the lobby is small but has chandeliers and fancy elevator doors my kids ages and loved it and felt as though they were royalty they also loved the regular revolving door on the side entrance the automatic revolving door at the main entrance moves very slowly and they were naturally inclined to push which only caused problems so dont give in to that urge,Positive
by the way nyc is noisysirens loud voices between buildings etci had a wonderful stay here this past weekend acutually three nights yes the room furnishings with the exception of the mattresses and tvs are antiquated but i personally loved iti wanted to go to a rangers game and a broadway show i walked a block to the game and a block to the subway which took me to my show i walked a whole block to take the subway to see the new citi fieldi did not take advantage to the conceirge but i knew i could rooms huge and i personally love the style though i hear they are renovating i didnt want to leave and the hotel even extended me one night at my original discounted rate though i didnt ask for the price breaknote bathrooms and kitchens are small in these style hotels but fully functionable the living areas are huge obviously a woman didnt design them water pressure in the shower is excellent cable is excellent with msg and yes if you are a sports fan plenty of radios for morning alarms snack and soda machines in the ll bar and restaurant which will let you take drinks upstairs,Positive
excellent hotel perfect location the door man greats you at the door the hotel staff are extremely welcoming you get your bags taken to your room and the bell boy shows you around the room which are massive we had a room on the th floor with a balcony over looking maddison square gardens you have a choice of pillows and you can change as many times as you want its great the rooms are clean and tidy we had a massive bed small bathroom but not too small a large tv with loads of channels a desk with chair a sofa chair and a small kitchen area with everything you need and a huge fridge and freezer i would definately recomment this hotel to everyone its in a central location over the road is maddison square gardens and one block from macys times square and even central park are within walking distance,Positive
the hotel is great and the staff were so helpful the rooms are spacious and clean and even have a little kitchen which is useful we moved rooms due to decorating on our floor but got a similar room higher up the only thing that lets this hotel down is the spa mentioned in brochure its not here its at a sister hotel many blocks away with all the walking we did a spa would have been perfect,Positive
we stayed for nights in affinia manhattan the place is clean and well appointed the rooms are large complete with a kitchenette space is definitely a plus as well as the excellent location right in front of penn station an madison square garden the shower is small but clean with good water and draining we were on the th floor facing th ave i believe and the noise level was tolerable the provide ear plugs but we never felt the need for it the heating was good service was quick and pain free got our rooms right away with no fuss when we checked in at pm we stayed for about a night there was a dog show the days we were there and we saw a lot of beautiful dogs with their owners staying at the hotel this was a treat for me but if youre allergic to pets please be aware that this hotel welcomes them i wold stay in the hotel again we had a wonderful experience,Positive
we stayed here for nights and could barely fault it you really couldnt choose a better location if you are coming to ny for a holiday penn station is opposite the hotel so we used the train to transfer from jfk this was really easy fast and only cost around for two of us you also have macys mins away and a min walk takes you to times square or the empire state building we booked through virgin holdays and our standard room with separate kitchen was enormous as was the very comfortable bed perhaps not the most modern decor but quality fittings nontheless and a very high standard of cleanliness throughout some noise could be heard from the street th floor but not too bad we had breakfast most mornings at bagel maven across the street and could recommend it bagels pancakes and cooked breakfasts were all excellent and reasonably priced hotel staff were very friendly and efficient and were obviously well trained made a pleasant change to the rather gruff attitude you can often get in new yorkall in all a very pleasant stay and i am so pleased we booked this hotel top marks affinia,Positive
my family of adults amp kids aged amp stayed at the affinia manhattan from dec jan on the night of our arrival pm we were advised that our bedroom suite was not available but they had a king suite ready for us we were so exhausted having had a lost piece of luggage then forgotten by our transport company for hours by the way do not use go airlink shuttle we couldnt be bothered arguing and took the room that was offered to us the room had qsb in the one room which was fine for the first night but we definitely wanted our ksb in the bedroom for the adults and the pull out sofa in the sitting room for the kids the hotel did offer us a usd reduction for the first night the following night they had our room ready which was great beds are very comfortable and you can have your choice of pillows the view from our window on the th floor was of madison square gardens we had a very spacious bedroom with ensuite and the kids had their own spacious room and bathroom the kitchen was very well equipped heating was good except that one of the space heaters did not turn off and was on the entire time very hot to touch and dangerous in case one of the kids touched iton new years eve we had room service at the hotel food was exceptional equal to any first class restaurant and a fraction of the price that most were asking for the nye meal location of hotel was great only a few blocks to times square shopping was great in madison and park avenues this time of year the sales were exceptional a definite must is ruby tuesdays amp bubba gumps eateries in times square we tried to get into red lobster amp hard rock but the lines were always too long we highly recommend quoton location toursquot we toured the tv show and movie sites of new york but they also have many others to choose fromwe went to see hairspray on broadway when in new york you must see a broadway show i stood in line for almost hours at tkts discount tickets for our tickets you never know what will be available when you get to the front of the line but whatever it is you wont be disappointedwe travelled by water taxi on the hudson river and came very close to the statue of liberty our tour was the last for the day and took place as the sun was setting spectacular scenesalso highly recommend the ground zero site it was a real eye opener to see the extent of the damage it is also amazing to see just how the new structures are being built fao schwartz great to see the big piano for those of you familiar with the movie quotbigquot m amp m world amp dylans candy store are fun to visit but dont over spend your budgetif you arent scared of heights we recommend top of the rock at the rockefeller centre amazing degree views of new york make sure you have good walking shoes on because you will be doing a great deal of walking,Positive
stayed here for nights on holiday with our teenage daughter the location opposite penn station and a couple of blocks from macys and the empire state building was outstanding the staff were very well organised and had a real quotcan doquot attitude whatever the query we arrived jet lagged check in was quick and efficient we had booked a one room suite which came with two bathrooms a huge bed one of the most comfortable i have ever slept in and a large sofa bed in the lounge for our daughter there were also two very large tvsnot that we did much tv watching new york is even better than billed we had been sent a tenday weater forcast along with a quotpillow menuquot and extras we could order about a week before we left the uk within an hour the special pillows arrived along with a freebie basket of yoga mat blocks and fitness geardvds etc the accommodation was great with lots of little touchesluxury aveeda toiletries fresh ground coffee replenishes each day kitchenette with huge fridge the concierge desk was really helpfulthey booked trips shows advised on transportation had loads of information at their fingertips and were just so friendly and helpful room was eighth floor double glazed spacious and quiet only complaint was the drawers in the clothing chest tended to fall out when you pulled them out to get your clothing we did cocktails one night in nilespricy but so was everywhere did not try restaurant or room service an italian lucasa couple of blocks away was recommended and we went there several times to eat,Positive
stayed here between xmas and new year early checkin was smooth with really good reception staff in fact all the service personnel were fantastic from the concierge through to the bellhop the room was large by ny standards with safe and workable kitchen in terms of the noise that i see mentioned by one or two people we had a room on a high floor and honestly i noticed no street noise with the windows shutthe foyer was great and all the public areas well maintained with a very well appointed business center with very quick but expensive internetthe location is superb a block or two from different subway lines round the corner from macys and bamph and next to penn station and madison square garden dozens of places to eat and in fact a restaurant that was ok attached to the hoteli made my reservation really well ahead of time and got a rate of around which i dont think will happen again at that price the affinia is the best buy in ny,Positive
this is the first time that ive encountered this problem booking through priceline after reserving the hotel through pricelinecom i called the hotel to request double beds in this quotall suitesquot affinia manhattan hotel the reservations told me that although the hotel in an quotall suitesquot there are a few single rooms only not suites that only accomidate a single bed these are the room booked through priceline i commented that they dont offer that single room on their website but she assured me that they exist because there are of us going i needed to upgrade to a regular room that had the option of a second bed this is the first hotel that ive ever encountered through priceline that discriminates based on where you booked,Positive
my husband my sons ages amp and i stayed at affinia manhattan for new years eve check in was very easy and the clerks were very helpful the only minor problem was i thought i requested a room with two beds instead of one there were none available so they gave me a rollaway bed for no charge my sons are both over six feet and sharing a bed would be very uncomfortable for them the location is great it is across the street from penn station if you take the train or take the megabus as other reviews say its a short walk to times square the kitchen is small but who cooks when youre on vacation there is also a coffee maker which is great for me although it is on the expensive side for four people its not bad for new york city i would definitely stay here again,Positive
our stay at the affinia was excellent the check in was great and easy the room was a huge room for the two of us staff was very accommodating and the location was great we booked through travelzoo for valentines day and only paid,Positive
i stayed at the affinia while i attended the westminster kennel club dog show the rooms were spacious and impeccably clean and fresh smelling checking in and out was a breeze and the staff was friendly and polite they granted every request with a smile and things were done in a timely manner i was traveling with my dog and they were very pet friendly too i will never go back for the dog show and stay anywhere else the affinia manhattan is a first class hotel and just steps from madison square garden,Positive
me and my partner found our stay at the affinia excellent we arrived into newark and caught the new jersey transit to penn station thehotel is just across the street easy walking distance to almost anywhere would recommend the ground zero museum workshop only hours out of your day but the memories will stay forever very moving brooklyn pizza tour also very good found our room to be slightly smaller than hoped for we booked a studio no kitchen to speak of really just a microwave coffee maker and fridge but adequate as we were not planning to eat in anyway we were on the st floor im a very light sleeper and did not find the noise disturbing great location for excellent restaurants shops and entertainment all on your doorstep reallythis was my th visit to new york first time in the affinia and liked the locationhotel so much im going back end of feb with girlfriends bed suite the rooms are very clean although maybe just a little tired this is an old hotel afterall,Positive
i stayed here last week with my family and friends and the girl we met at the check in desk was so helpful she was great the rooms were lovely we had between us but my room was right against the wall where elevators were going up and down all night the next morning we had to move rooms it was just soo noisy i dont know how they could put anyone in thereit was no problem to change and we got bumped to a beautiful room kitchenettes in this hotel are great and really come in handy i would definietly stay here again it was such a good location and all the staff seemed really friendlyone more thing is that if u forget to put your do not disturb sign on your room door the cleaning staff will walk in at am in the morning they did this to us most mornings and so when we locked the door they tried it anyway and knocked every hour on the hour until we left around am so def a good idea to put the sign up and put the lock on the door unless u want a wakeup call really earlyother than this i would highly recommend it the adjoining pub is great next door and across the road really great location,Positive
this is a hotel with a great location and reasonable rates for manhattan the lobby is very nice and the attached restaurantbar niles is quite good the staff were helpful and quite pleasant the rooms were okay our room had a smallish kitchen and decor dating from the s or so the room was clean and generally quiet even though we had a location overlooking msg the traffic noise was pretty moderate there are much nicer hotels in nyc but this place is well situated for most people needing to be in that area if they actually bring the rooms into the st century this location would be exemplary,Positive
my wife and i spent nights of out honeymoon at this hotel and overall we had a enjoyable stay the location is great we arrived via rail and had many suitcases and bags so being across the road from penn station was a bonus we saw all the sights of the city from trains via penn but we also did the easy min walk to times square a number of time the rooms are comfortable and the kitchen is a bonus however we found it difficult to buy groceries in the area so we ended up not even using the kitchen during the days a couple of negitives we like most travelers needed to do some laundry howveer the hotel laundry room is so hard to find its crazy after mins of looking i had to get a staff member to show me where it was and suprise suprise it is in the housekeeping area only acessable via the service elevators thats say staff only secondly my wife was pretty disgusted to find adult magazines featuring large women inside the drawer of the bedside table the cleaning staff must not check the room very well it just made you feel a bit sick thinking of who was in the bed the night before us it kinda put a damper on the honeymoon romance,Positive
of us stayed here in january for my sisters th of us shared a one bedroomed apartment and one person had a studio room the apartment was huge bathrooms great kitchen area dining table tvs and huge beds with a sofabed in the lounge area we were on th floor and were definitely not kept awake by any noise at nighthotel is in a great location the walk to times square doesnt seem so long after youve done it a hundred timesreception staff were friendly and when we used the information desk they were really helpful we also had room service late one night and the food was greatwould definitely recommend it and would love to go back,Positive
my boyfriend and i stayed at the affinia manhattan in jan arriving on new years day we arrived early pm and were told our room would be ready by pm returning at pm we were told that there still wasnt a room ready for us and that we would have to wait the lobby was really busy by then i think they had a problem with lots of staff not turning up postnew year celebrations we waited for over an hour before approaching the queue at reception again we finally got a room at pm this was not good as were were absolutely exhausted from the flight it was freezing outside and there were no seats in the lobby we perched on a windowsill i think this must have been a oneoff bad day for themapart from the bad start the hotel was great in every other way the room was a good size with a double bed and the best pillows ive ever slept on including my own the room was really easy to heat up and was a cosy haven after spending days out in the harsh weather loved it plenty of space for luggage and clothes in the builtin wardrobes and chest of drawers the decor was nice although i didnt like the blinds which often refused to cooperate with me the view was ok just buildings really but our room faced west so we saw some lovely sunsetsthe kitchen area had a hob gas cooker microwave toaster fridge and filter coffee machine as well as cutlery pots and utensils no kettle but you can heat water on the hob or in the microwave this was handy for making breakfast in our rooms so we didnt have to venture into the cold on empty stomachs there is a kmart near penn station which is probably the best place to buy basics like milk bread etc ask staff for directions there is also a whole foods supermarket if you walk down th ave towards chelsea nicer but a bit pricey and more fresh produce the bathroom was small with a shower no bath but it was clean and nicely fitted the shower was powerful although the cubicle was small could be a problem for somenew york is very noisy all through the night we were on floor total is floors in room and could still hear the traffic yet we slept like babies every night because were were tired and the bed was so comfy so it wasnt a problem the lobby has an information area where you can pick up free newspapers and helpful magazines like time out we barely interacted with the staff while we were there so cant comment on that other than to say they seemed generally helpful overall i would recommend the hotel the location is almost unbeatable and the kitchen really made it feel homely private and selfcontained perfect for couples who want to be alone we liked pretending it was our own little apartment the hotel facilities are basic but you dont go to new york and spend your precious time in a hotel,Positive
i went here with a friend and on arrival we were allocated a room with a double bed having specified on booking that it was to be twin rooms when we went back to reception we were told they couldnt gaurantee you would get the room you booked even though we had booked months in advance the receptionist was rude and very unhelpful saying we would have to pay for a camp bed after a long argument we were given this free and told we would get a room with twin beds the next day the room we got the following night was lovely ery big and had everything you could need this hotel is very noisy as it is right in the center of new york so if you like your sleep i would advise against this hotel however if you are here to shop ten tis hotel is great as it is ery central i would go back but only if the price was right i would definetly shop around more next time,Positive
warm and welcoming is the best way fo descibing this hotel my first impression when i walked up the stairs to the foyer was the grandeur of the place sure its a little dated but that adds to the characterwe were in room which had a great view overlooking seventh avenue in the distance we could see times square and directly below us was madisson sq gardenthe rooms are very comfortable and although we asked for a king size bed they gave us two queen size didnt really matter though as a queen size is big enough for the two of us anyway and we found ourselves with a choice of which to stay in on that particular nightthe room had its own kitchen and although we only used the fridge and the sink i suppose it is a nice additionthe location of the hotel is brilliant walk north directly up th avenue and you got times square grab a cab south and your on the way to the statue of liberty etc basically you are in a great central locationas with most places in new york the food is very good the room service is supplied by the restaurant next door try the angus burger the best weve tastedwe were in new york for days over the new year which was fantastic and the hotel didnt let us down one bitoverall id recommend this hotel to anyone i know who is visiting new york this hotel is in an ideal position if you were watching one of the big boxing flights at madisson square garden lets hope hatton fights over there againmy girlfriend and i have said well be back there at some point in the future and wed definitely be staying at the affinia again,Positive
the hotel is right by penn station making it very easy to get to everything by train we never even bothered with a taxi short walk to the empire state building tooour suite was huge the bedroom had two queen beds tv and nice sized bathroom the living room had a fairly comfortable sofabed tv desk full bathroom and fullsized kitchen lots of cupboard and drawer space we didnt bother to cook but the kitchen was well enough equipped it would be comfortable for a weeklong stayonly drawback no table with chairs for eating meals brought in,Positive
my experience here was a nightmare i depend on internet access which they advertised for my job this is where i had my largest problem first its per day for internet access even to browse the internet in the business center you have to pay second if something goes wrong and you cant access the internet do not expect them to help you i was given an user name that didnt work and the management had absolutely no idea what to do to help me nor did the technical support staff i spent hours on a monday morning desperately trying to get access to the internet all i needed was a user name that worked to no avail and the management acted like i was imposing on them by asking for help the manager even said quotim not a technical personquot as if i was sol and was on my own to try to figure it out you would think that a hotel of this size with frequent business travelers would be prepared to respond if a guess had a username that didnt workas for the room itself the floor i stayed on reeked of smoke despite the fact that this is supposedly a nonsmoking hotel guest services had a humidifier sent up to help with the smell but the fan in the humidifier was noticeably covered in mold and dirt it was almost offensive that they would send it up to me in that statethe room was also noisy and tired you can tell that they are not bothering to put much money into updating the rooms tv carpet furniture cheap and oldthere are some things about the hotel that are good but they do not quite redeem it for me first the rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable you can order from a menu of different pillow types the room service is from a restaurant in the hotel that is not bad which is saying a lot when it comes to room service in a hotel of this caliber i asked for a dvd player to play my yoga dvd and they brought it right up and set it up for mein sum i would say that the only reason to stay in this hotel would be if you got a very good rate its not worth the rate i was paying nearly per night i transfered to the kintano after my internet issue and it is soooo much nicer let me reiterate soooo muuuuch niiicer for the same priceshop around and only stay in the affinia if it is the cheapest option and you wont depend on internet,Positive
we stayed at the affinia manhattan in jan for nights and the hotel was ideal for our purposeswe wanted a base from where we explore manhanttan and it certainly provided this being in midtown only a couple of minutes walk from macys the empire state building and fifth avenue the famous madison square garden is almost directly across the road from the entrance of the affinia and with penn station under that we were able to get a train straight from newark airport to penn station and then walked all of a couple hundred yards to the hotelideal after a long flightthe hotel itself is clean and tidy and the rooms are very spacious we had a kitchenette area within ours which we mainly used for coffees and the odd breakfast but to be honest if you come to new york you should eat out little korea was only around the corner from this hotel and you can get some very good quality meals at reasonable prices for a major citykaraoke is optional,Positive
location good but a bit of a transit point no real soul to ithotel rooms are in bad condition room not ready when we arrived at pm sorry to say this didnt happened just to ushad to wait hours to be given a horrible room everything was falling appart natania the recepcionist did her best and changed to a more acceptable room cannot say the same about other staffstaff irregularvery niceneuroticrude it depends on your luck nice cleaning ladys toughhorrible restaurant staff unskilled in every waybeing obliged to pay cumpulsory service to this people is a jokeive stayed in affinia dumont and it was a totally different experiencefrom now on the quotaffiniaquot concept means nothing to me,Positive
can not disagree more with the last person to write a reviewif you want book the plaza and pay a couple of grand a night if you want the best you can get for the money you have you cannot go wrong with the affinia manhattanthe hotel was lovely we stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was huge a little well lived in but spotlessly clean and fit all our requirements you are so busy with things to do in ny all you want is a comfy bed and the affinia manhattan certainly had that my husband requested a top floor room with a view of the empire state building the staff bent over backwards to accommodate our requests and where extremely helpful and friendly they gave us fantastic advice on places to visits gave us maps and directions on how to get there we had a number of excursions we pre booked here in the uk and the staff phoned them all on arrival to re confirm our bookingthe location was very good we walked everywhere took about min to get to time square but it was a lovely walk and we did it dailyi have recommended the affinia to my in laws and they are staying there later this year with any luck i will stay there again next year,Positive
ive just come back from new york we stayed in the affinia manhattan having read the review i expected a huge clean suite with a tired decor thats exactly what i got and i was very happy with it the reception and housekeeping were friendly and very efficient i am most definately going to stay here again location was excellent diagonally opposite madisson square garden walk to times square and a minute walk to the empire state building penn station one of the main amtrak and subway station was mins from your hotel we caught the sub way to the port for the statue of liberty ferry and the subway to the natural history musuem the maven bagel was opposite the hotel the breakfast here was great and the lunch time early evening food was fantastic next door to this was harrington very very nice for a lunch time or evening meal cant wait to get back therehave a good trip,Positive
we arrived at this hotel for our first stay in new york we cannot disagree with some of the comments particularly regarding its location for sight seeingon arrival we were impressed with the entrance and the standard of service from the desk when we got our keys and strated to make our way to the room we had been allocated we started to worry the carpets were a bit shabby and needed a good clean on arrival on our floor it was even more disappointing and there was a smell but entering the room was a real blowthe room was just horrible we booked a studio and it was in a terrible state a lamp shade was falling to bits sliding doors fell off the funiture was shabby and the kichenette looked as if it had been built pre the bathroom was cramped and in a similar decorative style the bedroom was very cramped not the standard we had comne to expecte of new york or the usawe had also asked for a quiet room so we got one on the nd floor next to the service liftwe complained and the attitude changed immediately there were no other rooms and they we all of the same standard but we were promised a better room the following daywe were not the only ones to complain a group of three businessmen and a couple from england were also very unhappy with their rooms the businessmen were given a better room but the other couple we told they had to wait until the following day for a better roomwe checked out immediately but asked for a refund as we had prebooked four days they declined and told us we had to make the claim from the agents the general managers office had the same respopnse to our claim and whilst the person we spoke to was sympathetic she was not prepared to give any ground so we complained and got the best part of our money back less the first night hence we have not written this review beforewe wold never go back to the affina there are far better hotels in new york and manhatten,Positive
we stayed here for nights between th dec and nd jan and loved it the rooms were clean and spacious the staff were friendly and would do anything for you it exceeded all our expectations would def stay here again,Positive
we had a great experience a good choice for a family of five beautiful lobby great front desk staff they remembered it was my daughters th birthday she was so excited pillow menu is fun rooms are large two bathrooms kitchen was fantastic a little noisy at night with outside noise but overall a good experience especially if taking the train tofrom penn station,Positive
we booked our holiday to experience the magic of christmas in new york and were so pleased with our choice of hotel the central location was great for both sightseeing and christmas shopping just a couple of blacks away from macys and despite being so close to the fire station our room on the th floor was quiet enough to relax in after a long day out exploring the city while most hotels in new york seem to offer only tiny rooms our room was huge with a superkingsized bed seating area desk and walkin cupboard having a kitchen too was an added bonus and great for storing items bought at the deli a couple of doors down the breakfast baps come highly recommended we found the staff at the hotel friendly and helpful whenever we sought advice contributing to the lovely atmosphere in the hotel when we arrived late after the airline had lost my luggage they offered straight away at no extra charge to have a bag of toiletries sent up to the room rather than allowing me to go out looking for an allnight chemist in search of a toothbrush a touch we really appreciated and a minor problem with the heating which we reported on the first morning was rectified by the time we arrived back that evening another example of the professional service we receivedwe stayed in this hotel for a week and would recommend it to anyone for location cleanliness and attitude of the staff it was a pleasure to stay here and i could have happily moved in permanently,Positive
christmas shopping end of nov with partner and friend we stayed for nights and had a fantastic time the hotel is in a great location the staff very helpful and as for the room it was a small apartment never slept in such a huge bedwe have been to new york before and stayed at the waldorf astoria which was beautifulwe are going back to new york in and will be booking the affinia,Positive
amazing experience our stay was everything we could ask for in a quality hotel from our arrival to our departure and everything in between during the bustle of christmas the hotel stayed on top of our many requests perfect location to cant wait to make my second trip to nyc definitely booking at the affinia again,Positive
i traveled to new york to spend some time with family over the holidays the affinia manhattan was a great place to stay this was the first time that i stayed at the affinia and i loved the location it was very close to macys madison square garden subway restaurants the list goes on and on the staff was great they allowed us to check in early and was very helpful with getting us anything that we needed and answering any questions we had during our trip i would recommend this hotel to anyone,Positive
this hotel is in a perfect location for exploring manhattan the reception staff were very friendly and helpfull and we were able to check in hours early the hotel lobby was very grand and had a beautiful christmas tree our room was on the st floor with a great view i would recommend to ask for a room high up as traffic noise is loud spacious room and kitchen the bathroom was fairly small although nothing to worry about we were very impressed with the affinia and would definetly stay there again,Positive
we resided in the affinia manhattan for five nights and checked out new years day i cannot recommend this hotel enough and do not have a bad word to say about it the location was perfect for all the major sights and all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly the quality and comfort of the room was excellent and we even had a balcony we will definitely be returning,Positive
my partner and i travelled to new york on the th of november we arrived to the affinia hotel after pm staff at the reception were so nice and porters were most helpful i was amazed to see how spacious our room was it was fab for nights we were so near times square and macys it was great we walked everywhere great exercise the male conceirge was most helpful he booked tickets to go see the lion king for us and helped us make a reservation at the marriott revolving restaurant in times square which to me was a total surprise as what i didnt know at the time it would be to celebrate our engagementi would definatly recommend this hotel for business shopping romantic get aways lovely hotel only thing is food expensive ie breakfast best eating at the euro cafe about m from the hotel,Positive
stayed at affinia manhattan dec and really couldnt fault it staff were very friendly and fast with check in our room however had the noisiest heating pipes ever we mentioned this to reception and they changed our room within minutesthe rooms are excellent very big clean and extremely comfortablethought the location was fantastic minute walk from madison square gardens minutes walk from times square and a great view of the empire state building from our window also very handy for penn station and subway right over the road we got a taxi from jfk to hotel for flat rate of plus toll plus tip however for returning to jfk we took a much cheaper route which was also very easy go accross to penn station and follow signs for lirr long island rail road buy a ticket to jamaica station get off at jamaica and get the air train from there direct to jfk total cost of per person in peak time so cheaper out of peak very easy journey toohotel is expensive for water etc we were charged for a bottle on room service if you go out main door of hotel and turn left there is a shop almost next door that sells water juice bagels etc much cheaperfor breakfast we found lindys just a short walk to the right really expensive for people andrews which is a bit further on was better for but the best and cheapest was maven bagels leave the hotel and cross the road walk left and it is on the first corner i think definately worth it if you are on a budgetwould recommend going up to the top of the rockefeller centre rather than the empire state same price but much better open viewfor evening views there is a revolving restaurant at the top of the marriott in times square they do buffett or restaurant slightly expensive but its a nice experiencebe really really careful if you are buying tickets from the touts outside madison square gardens we were sold counterfeits so lost very annoying most are genuine i think we were just unlucky but its a lot of money to lose with no way of getting it backalso avoid hot dogs from street sellers my fiance and i had horrific food poisoning which wiped out almost hours of our tripall in all amazing holiday and fantastic hotel just remember everyone needs tipped in new york enjoy,Positive
my boyfriend and i stayed here for a week from th december and the overall experience could not be faulted the lobby to the hotel is very grand and the staff we encountered were very helpful and informative we were in a basic room the studio suite which was more than sufficient for the two of us the room had a huge and very comfortable king size bed an ample sized bathroom with plenty of towels and replenished aveda toiletries and a kitchen the kitchen had a full size fridge cooker microwave teacoffeemaker pots and pans cutlery and crockery etc we used the kitchen mainly for storing drinks and snacks but for a family or somebody on a more basic budget it would be ideal for making breakfast and quick mealswe had room service from niles restaurant on the first night we arrived and the food was tasty portion size was good and it was valuie for money before you arrive be sure to use the my concierge facility of the hotels website from here you can make simple requests for your room choose pillows from the menu on offer request toiletries arrange transportation and book trips and shows previous reviews have commented on noise we were on the th floor of the hotel and were not troubled by noise from the lifts or from other rooms but you can hear the street there is a police station on th street and a church with regular bell ringing on st street if you are a light sleeper i would recommend taking ear plugs the location of the hotel is ideal for anybody wanting to see the sightstouristy side of new york and for the shoppers alike madison square garden is facing the hotel macys is a two minute walk away the empire state building and broadway are each about a fiveten minute walk while central park is approximately twenty minutes walk i would return to the affinia any time and would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone for a good start to the day i would suggest having breakfast at tick tock diner on th avenue and th street the food was nice and the portions are huge one place i would strongly advise everybody avoid is katzs deli it was an absolute dump and the food was vile do not waste your time or money heading to this socalled landmark after our experience here we think it should be closed down,Positive
we booked our stay for affinia manhattan because of all the positive reviews about this hotel on this website i must tell you my husband and i were very pleased we went up for my th birthday we took the train from dc to penn affinia is perfect if you are traveling by train the hotel is right across the street from penn station it is also centrally located and th the staff was very courtious and helpful raney not sure of spelling was very helpful to us as well as the other concierges the room was extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable i will say if you are expecting a palatial type of hotel this is not the one for you this is a very nice clean helpful and just perfect hotel a bit on the older side but we liked that aspect of it the beds are actual beds and not the box hotel type we had music welcoming us when we walked in i asked for a room with a view on the top floor and we were given exactly that we will definitely stay there again thank you so much affinia trip advisor and reviewers for a perfect th,Positive
my girlfriend and i stayed the affinia manhattan from dec untill jan and this hotel was awesome when we first arrived we weretold that we were going to be staying on the fifth floor we asked the manager kyle if we can stay on a higher floor and she then put us on the floor we were told that the room was going to be made in hour so we went for dinner and when we came back our luggage was already put inside our roomthis hotel was really fantastic because it was in the middle of everything we wanted to do in new york city it was right in front of penn station and really close to macys and the empire state building its only about a min walk into times square and there are lots of neat little restaurants near by the best part was there is a concierge desk right in the middle so you can book your tickets right there maureen concierge was really helpful she helped us get to where we wanted to go right away we booked our sex and the city tour right there and we also booked our new york hop on hop off tourthis hotel was really mindblowing because it was really nicely decorated and its really nice from the minute you walk in to your room its really nice the rooms were nice they are not small and not large they are medium size i know a lot of people complain about the washroom but they are a normal size washroom the beds were so comfortable and you get to choose which pillow you would like for the night housekeeping was excellent everytime we ordered pillows they would bring it to us right away the noise to be quite honest we actually did not hear to much noise the noises that we did hear was just nyc being nyc honks hear and there and thats about all we were on the floor and we slept like babies i did not hear any fire engines any police cars just honks from cars and thats about all i actually wanted to hear the fire engine as people said in the reviews but i did not hear anything we would stay the affinia manhattan anytime this was our first time to nyc and we had a blast the best part of nyc was this hotel is in the middle of it all all in all this hotel wasawesome fantasticmindblowing,Positive
stayed at this hotel for days just after christmas the hotel itself is really central close to penn station so easy to get to many attractions close by macys empire state building madison square gardens we did arrive a little early for check in which is pm but they were happy to do the initial booking in they did offer us a room away from the main street which is very busy all the time happy to accept and got a room on the th floor the main reception areas are clean and well laid out with the old fashioned lift facias all so far so good the floor we were living on was a little tired and dated but practical our room was adequate large bed kitchen area plenty of drawer space and cupboards unfortunately the toilet was tiny but enough for what you need it for toiletries are nice too unfortunatley our room was cold in the evenings but too warm in the mornings and the windows are drafty the blinds on two of our three windows were filthy but still worked the view was nondescript but they did say that in reception we looked directly into an office although we were away from the traffic it was still noisy when the fire engines and police cars put their sirens on there are plenty of eating places around the hotel so you never have to travel too far for food dont use the recommended whole foods supermarket the hotel advise as we found it very expensive probably cheaper to eat out for a couple it was for a box of corn flakes one more point the church bells ring every night and morning but fortunately for a very short time,Positive
the affinia offers suites so it was a good choice for a family with kids who wanted a place within walking distance of time square for new year the hotel staff were helpful the suite had bedrooms and a sofa bed so it was fine it was basic and clean there was enough linen toiletries and towels and when we asked for more it came good position fitness room ok but no ac and dreadfully hot kitchen basic but with cooker fridge microwave coffee and tea provided bell staff and concierges were very helpful overall good experience,Positive
this hotel is in a fantastic location right oppostive maddison square gardens and a shortish walk to times square the rooms are clean and very adequate but not what you would call posh new york is a very noisy place and this hotel is right near a fire station so there is noise from the engine the americans love to beep on their bull hornschecking out was really easy as you could check out on your television in your room we arrived at about pm and we were lucky as our room was ready but there was lots of people waiting around who were told there rooms were not ready a very enjoyable stay,Positive
booked through ebookers which was easy peasyth th december arrived at affinia manhattan and was met with pure professional handling by all the hotel staff we had booked a studio suite which was a large room with kitchenette to one side a large bathroom with shower and amazing view looking onto the empire state building on day one i spoke to one of the reception staff who enquired if it was our first visit to the us which it was and why we had chosen ny it was to celebrate my th birthday and our th anniversary on arrival back at the hotel we were aproached by the on duty manager and he offered us a free room upgradewe were moved into a one bedroom suite large bedroom large living room with office large kitchen fully kitted out and large bathroom and as we were now on the th floor a more amazing view onto the empire state buildingthe first room we had was more than adequate but our free upgrade was amazingthe hotel is situated in an ideal location mins to macys across the road from madison square gardens and mins casual walk to times square reception staff at the hotel were always courteous and helpful in every waywe purchased a day hop on hop off bus trip which got us around everywhere up the empire state staten island tour and the statue of libertywoodbury common is well worth the one hour journey by bus lots of bargains and fab shops much cheaper than bloomingdales and macys a fantastic trip went with virgin atlantic again fab and make sure you prebook your flight seat hours in advance on their website enjoyed every minute especially as we had a day of snow there too,Positive
the hotel has advantages but these were outweighed by the noiseafter we put our kids to bed on the sofabed in the front room in the room suite there was a great deal of noise first there was construction noise from an allnight construction site nearby the window next to the bed was not properly closed by the piece of wood around the room air conditioner the noise was loud even though we asked for and got a very high floor then after we finally got to sleep there was screaming in the room on the other side of the bedroom wall loud enough to wake up both my wife and myself from a sound sleep we called the desk at am and were assured the noise would stop it actually took a long time to stop we dont know if the desk spoke to the room or not we did not hear anyone eg security guard in the hallway thank goodness our kids did not get woken up by the noise but it was very unpleasant for us the front desk staff was very helpful at checkout and made us feel better about the whole thing but it was not an experience we would want to repeatfront desk wait for checkin was interminable checkout slightly better at least the front desk staff made a small accommodation in the bill the desk clerk seemed genuinely concerned about the noise still this hotel will not be our first choice in the future,Positive
i stayed at the affinia manhattan from october this was my sixth time in nyc but it was my first time staying at the affinia i normally stay in the times square area but decided on this hotel based on its positive reviews and great location i was a bit skeptical after reading so many positive reviews but i can honestly say the hotel lived up to every positive review it has received the hotel itself doesnt look all that spectacular from the outside however once you step inside youll be amazed the lobby area as well as the entire hotel is very clean when i made my reservation i booked a one bedroom suite with a terrace the first thing i did when i made my way to my room was run right out on the terrace it was simply amazing my room was on the th floor and the view was fabulous the terrace was huge and came complete with a table and chairs which proved to be the perfect place to eat all my meals during my stay in the city the room was kept very clean and was extremely spacious more importantly though it was so quiet maybe it was because i was on such a high floor but i was never bothered by any noise it came complete with a full kitchen and i must admit that having a refrigerator was very useful the king size bed was very comfortable i read some reviews that stated the bathrooms in the hotel rooms at the affinia were on the small side but i honestly felt the bathroom was pretty roomy all in all the affinia manhattan exceeded my expectationsthe only bad part was checking out of the hotel i really did feel like this was my home away from home while in nyc i highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here in the future,Positive
i have stayed in several hotels in new york and this one is the best there were five of us traveling together adults and children and we stayed in a bedroom suite the room was huge compared to other hotel rooms more than enough room for all of us it was the childrens first trip to new york and to begin and end our adventure at this lovely hotel made it more special the staff is extremely courteous helpful fast and always available i cannot recommend this hotel highly enough if your stay is anything like ours you will not be disappointed,Positive
chose this hotel after reading the reviews on this site and stayed for a full seven days everything stacked up well very good location five minutes stroll from macys close to the empire state building and penn subway across the road the staff are very friendly and accommodating got exactly the room we asked for half way up bath etc the positives worth noting nice soaps and shampoos spacious room and huge bed nice touches were the free access to the internet to reserve our airline seats home and being allowed to stay in our room till pick up at pm on the day of departure for no extra cost the hotel linked restaurant was also very good offering fine if pricey food the adjacent bar got very busy every evening cant say if that happens all the time as we were there the week before christmas any negatives well having a fridge in the room is fine in the summer but noisy and irrelevant in the midwinter and though the curtains in the room look nice they dont draw the hotel should think about putting some in that do not only to cut out any light but also to help keep the freezing temperatures hitting the windows at bay overall though an enjoyable visit,Positive
my best friend amp i ventured to new york for a quotgirls weekendquot june amp our stay at the affinia manhattan was nothing but excellent this hotel was not our first choice we were supposed to stay at the affinia dumont but i later found an excellent deal via travelzoo i am so elated we chose the affinia manhattan amp saved almost at first i was apprehensive because the price was so low you know what people say quotyou get what you pay forquot i could not imagine laying my head in a hotel which was filthy nor unwelcoming boy were my thoughts wrong when my friend amp i arrived we were greeted by an energetic and helpful doorman the location is perfect for tourist the staff was tremendous except for one rude amp less than knowledgeable concierge and most importantly the room was clean we requested a high floor and was accommodated with no problems i read the reviews about the firehouse behind the hotel therefore we were being proactive i am miserable without proper sleepthe hotels accommodations amp location were wonderful times square is a hop away shopping on nearly every corner penn station across the street tour bus stops right on th avei think there were vending machines on the bottom floor of the hotel a grocery store a few doors down the street go this route and save on breakfast starbucks across the street good room service last but not least the beds were so darn comfy i had to prye my head from the pillow each morning imagine having that big bed to yourself no husband or kids yes im sure you understand i was in heavenour trip to nyc was what we needed yet to short there is so much more to see in wonderful nyc in so little time we have already scheduled another trip for of course we will be staying at the affinia manhattan thank affinia manhattan for a wonderful stay well see you in months,Positive
my friend and i stayed at the affinia manhattan from thth december and were absolutely thrilled with it the location cannot be bettered on seventh avenue right opposite madison square gardens and penn st subwayimpressive lobby with very helpful staff especially maureen the concierge who booked all our tours for us and was so pleasantour room had the most fabulous view sitting up in bed looking straight out of the window to times square the room was huge with queen size beds the most comfortable i have ever slept in adequate bathroom and a fab kitchen with microwave fridge freezer and even a full size cooker should you want it we went on the harlem soul food and jazz tour which was amazing soul food at sylvias in the heart of harlem and dancing at the cotton club brilliant night out also try scots pizza tour a hour walk round little italy and soho with stops at the most amazing authentic pizza houses excellent value for money and scott was so informativethe sales were amazing value and we shopped until we dropped for fab atmosphere and amazing cocktails try harringtons bar right over the road from the hotelall in all we had the most brilliant trip and this hotel is one of the best i have stayed at in new york,Positive
we stayed at the affinia manhattan for nights in early sept and had a great stay the staff were very friendly the room was spacious and the location is excellent the hotel is roughly equal distance around blocks to central park in one direction and chinatownlittle italy in the otherid read other reviews which indicated the area could be noisy then again it is the centre of new york so i emailed in advance and asked for a room on a higher floor this resulted in the manager holding an apartment on the th floor there are floors the apartment itself from what i hear of new york standards was positively huge it had a large bedroom loungestudy small kitchen two bathrooms plus views over the city and hudson river the rooms were smartly decorated and kept very clean the niles restaurant is definitely worth a visit by our experience it was just over averagely priced but the food was really lovely and the potions were very large the bar which is right next to the restaurant is a great base to start an evening out and again the bar staff were very friendly and informative if you need any tips on a good day or night out these guys the porters or the people on the main desk will have some good tipsfor reference i booked this trip through quotbestatnewyorkquot who were offering the best deal at the time the on line holiday search facility worked very well and the people on the end of the phone knew their stuff which helped towards us having a problem free fab tripso thanks again to all the staff at the affinia manhattan for a brilliant stay i cant emphasise how friendly all staff at the hotel were we would definitely recommend it to friends and its at the top of our list if we do make a return trip to ny,Positive
myself my partner and another couple stayed here for nights at the beginning of the month and we were not disappointed with the hotel the hotel was clean the staff were very friendly and the location was brilliant only a short walk to empire ste builing times sqaure and macysthere was plently of places to eat around the hotel aswell we stayed in a bed suite and it was lovely we had bathrooms a small kitchen the maid was here evryday and i could not fault the cleanliness we were on the th floor and yes there was some noise but what do you expect in the big apple we never came all the way from scotland for some peace and quietwould definitely recommend this place and will stay here again when i come back,Positive
three friends and i booked this hotel through travelocitys last minute package prior to our trip none of us were at all familiar with the hotel and were very pleasantly surprised upon arrivalthe lobby was extremely nice and very large because our flight put us in the city at in the morning and checkin wasnt until later that afternoon we were happy to hear that the hotel would store our luggage at no extra cost until our room was readythe room itself was very large a studio suite with beds the four of us brought a ton of luggage and left with even more yet the room never seemed too crowded with all of our belongings it was very nice to have the couch and the kitchen areathe only drawback was the tiny tiny bathroom there was very little room to move around and one of our inside jokes for the entire trip was that the bathroom was actually a closetthe actual location of the hotel was very convenient its a block away from madison square gardens and a block away from the and lines the europe cafe is on the same block and we enjoyed breakfast there every morningi highly recommend this hotel to anyone,Positive
i really cannot say enough about the affinia manhattan the location is absolutely phenomenal i travelled here in dec and again in sept for a show at madison square garden and its perfection there are so many restaurants in the area and nothing beats only having to cross the street after a performance i found the staff to be incredibly lovely and helpful we arrived earlyand hungry so the sweet girlamanda i think recommended the cosmic cafe around the corner it was the ultimate nyc experience and delish also i booked the wrong type of room than i thought and when brought to their attention was moved to what i had wanted it was completely my error and they quickly placed us in a room with separate sleeping quartersto keep the snorer away it was no problem at all and i very much appreciated her help as for the rooms i think they are nice and spacious for nyc and they are kept very well the beds are too die for comfortable so be prepared for a great rest our bellman was the sweetest man ever and was incredibly helpful and friendly whenever we saw him we were only there for an overnightto see a concert but since the affinia is so centrally locatedempire state macys bus tours right around the corner we were able to do so much in our limited time we saw more in hours than we have in weekend trips weve taken elsewhere if you were traveling to a show at madison square garden i would recommend no other place i cannot wait to go back in april,Positive
i stayed again at the affinia manhattan for my weeks visit to nyc for a trade show i stay or nights and this is my fifth tripi book through the convention siteupon booking i wasnt given the option for the normal bedroom suite i usually get so i booked the studio figuering i would save a bit of money and didnt really need the one bedroom this year anywaywhen i arrived they had my resie but a studio with only one bed i thought i had requested two beds i told the staff that i didnt really want to share a bed with my brotheri had been on the webpage the week before and they had the bedroom suites available at discounted ratesso i mentioned this the the staff and said i would prefer the bedroom she dissapeared into the back room and came back sayingk since i was staying nights and that they could upgrade me at a certain price for the convention so she gave me the choice of a room ready to go or wait until for one with two bathrooms i was tired from the flight from hawaii so i opted for the ready room after inspection i turned it down as its floorplan was stange and the bedroom had no windows no problem was the response from the staff so i check my bags and headed to katz for my annual pastami fixi returned after pm and room was ready this room was much better with a nice layout and two bathrooms the other plus is they have kitchens so i ate breakfast most veryday in room and we were able utilize leftovers from nyquots great eateriesso i settled inas some will mention the affinia is located next to he fire dept and the police station is a block downneedless to say there is quite a bit of street noisenot the hotels fault its just they way it isthis year it seemed the fire engines were called out quite a bit more than previous yearsaffinia has great beds very nice linens and well appointed if small bathrooms and a pillow menu at no chargethe same doorman concierge bellman have been there for the past yearsso when i come up from penn station into the madness from mellow hawaii its really great to see familiar facesall in all affinia manhattan is a great place for the value and locationhopefully i will returning next year for another thanksgiving in the city,Positive
just realised by looking through reviews i had never left mine stayed here in march at the st patricks weekend it was just me and the wife and had always wanted to see the parade and stuff and as it fell on a saturday decided to do it had previously stayed at the hampton on st street so wanted the same area as i feel it is ideally located for going anywhere in manhattan what i also like is we could fly into jfk get the airtrain round and then train from jamaica to penn station you come out penn station and there is the hotel check in was nice and easy the room was a great size small kitchen which was good but we only used it for the fridge bathroom and shower was smaller than expected and could be made bigger but it served its purpose you could at times here the fire trucks through the night but to me it is all part of the new york feeling the hallways and lifts were also fine to me and the bar and restaurant were good as well when myself and my wife and maybe even the kids come back to new york i would look at staying here again but as with everything it would depend on the price at the time we paid through travelzoo per night which i think is a decent price i live in ayrshire scotland and cant wait till my next time in new york and hopefully it will be at the affiinia manhattan,Positive
i booked this hotel after weeks and weeks of research as it seemed the most suitable hotel for our budget we wanted a central hotel with a good standard of accomodation and the reviews on tripadvisor helped with our decision i never stay anywhere without consulting ta at lengthour initial impressions on arriving were good but check in was an absolute farse for one they dont have enough staff on front desk for the size of the hotel having booked an early flight out of the uk we arrived at the hotel at about pm we were told that our room a one bedroom suite wasnt quite ready and to wait behind the pillar in front of reception for our call we waited patiently for around minutes before enquiring again and were told that our room was going to be another hour how nice of them to have not informed us about this right from the start so we decided to hit the hotel bar and wait there instead im going off on a bit of a tangent here but the hotel bar was lovely great atmosphere brilliant and friendly bar staff and a great choice of drinks and cocktails im guessing its a bit of a meeting place for locals as the bar was packed most evenings great choice of bar nibbles toowell we got comfy and about minues later and lighter we went back to reception we were told another minutes well you can imagine our reaction wed been at the hotel for over hours and still no room we felt as though we had wasted an entire afternoon checking in and being messed around and time is precious in new york when youre on a city break if our room wasnt going to be ready until pm tell us so that we can hit the city well we blew our tops a bit the receptionist gave us some free drinks vouchers as wed been spending our good money in their bar whilst wed been waiting and promised to come and collect us once shed been given the green light on our room to her credit she did but after another hour this was all totally ridiculous and a complete waste of timethank goodness we were pleased with the room the room was spacious very clean and looked newly refurbished the furnishings were a little basic and sparce for the size of the room but the bed was so comfortable and we had a very enjoyable stay in room on the th floor the rooms do have a small kitchenette which is completely unnecessary in my opinion and we would have rather and done without as the fridge made a right racket during all hours as if new york isnt nosy enough it rained quite heavily for two days too and the constant drip drip outside on the air conditioning unit made for a good nights sleep not but you dont come to new york to sleep so cant really complain too much therethe location of this hotel sold it to us completely two blocks from macys minutes to the empire state and minutes up to times square there are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby if your feet are tired at the end of the day and penn station is directly opposite with access to anywhere on manhattan and beyond i think that this hotel trades off of its location unfortunately and customer service levels have suffered as a resultone final note i dropped an email to this hotel a week prior to departure telling them that we were really looking forward to our visit and requesting a room with a nice view i didnt even get an acknowledgement to this and the view was pretty average after our debarcle at reception though im not surprised what this hotel achieves in terms of location it totally lacks in terms of customer service i am not normally a complainer when it comes to hotels but i would stay somewhere else next time,Positive
we have never been to new york before and were told to book a to and half star hotel as below this was questionable we could not have been happier with the room suite we occupied loved our stay at the manhattan and would certainly stay there againnot cheapbut received more than i expectedstaff were very helpfuljust superb service all round val and briannoosa queensland australia,Positive
for a room on one of the higher floors we were on the rd floor of the hotel and the noise is really quite loud day amp night although you cannot expect peace and quiet because of the location of the hotel on the floor that we were on the noise from the sirenscar horns is signicant the rooms were large and spacious and although a little tired were extremely clean having a fridge hob amp microwave were a great bonus plenty of towels in the bathroom and the comfiest biggest bed ive met there was a safe in the wardrobe iron amp ironing board and hairdryerfantastic location took us only about minutes to walk to times square and penn station is just across the roadthe only real complaint i had was with the air conheating even when it was turned off it was noisy,Positive
we booked the hotel through thomson never again as a package holiday hotel flight transfersthe hotel itself is in a fantastic place situated directly opposite madison square gardens and penn station its about minutes from maceys and minutes to times squarethe hotel was actualy going under some changes while we were there but nothing noisy and drastic to start with the hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful we booked a room with kitchen facilities through thomson but when we arrived they had only given us a guest room under thomsons instructions but they changed the room for us moving us to the th floor they were also extremely helpful when we checked in what thomson failed to tell us was that you need a visa card to go as a deposit for the room neither my girlfriend or myself have a visa so we were stumped and had to lay down a cash deposit but again the staff were helpful and lowered the rate so it didnt dent our cash flow as for the room the guest room we was originally put in was tiny although it looked nice enough it was way too small and had the smallest bathroom ever the nd room we were put in was huge it had a large queen size bed a big tv nice size kitchen and a small bathroom but big enough to do whats neededthe aircon was great and the heating worked a treat as for the noise complaints ive read about what do you expect in nyc the place is always noisey go to the lake district if you dont like the noisefor us it was a great homebase you have a small shop next door for food tons of take aways and bars around you minutes from the shopping areas of maceys etc and a few steps from the subways which lead to anyway you want to godefinately advise any usa new commers to check out the small pizza shop a few doors down head right as you leave the hotel past the fuse adverts and go to the nd pizza place get a gyro sandwhich they rockall in all we would definately return here and plan to do so in fantastic place,Positive
stayed at the affinia manhattan for four nights at the end of november over thanksgiving weekend with two girlfriends for a long weekend of shopping and sightseeing for us the most important things when looking for a hotel were location price and safety and the affinia excelled on all threewe were on the th floor and didnt have any problems with noise at all although the hotel is on a really busy street which is excellent for shopping eating and getting a cab easily we were very pleased to have a large kitchen with a massive fridge which to be fair was fairly old but very clean and usable the bathroom was pretty tiny but if three girls with all their hairdryers and stuff can manage then im sure most people can and we didnt go to nyc to sit in the bathroom anyway the beds were mega comfortable too and we didnt have any problems at allthe concierge are helpful so feel free to use them as much as you want and the front desk has a kiosk where you can check in online before your return flight which was really useful and you can leave your luggage for free if you have an afternoon or evening flightwe were very pleased with our choice of hotel particularly because we spent between of us for nights and would definitely recommend it to others wanting to be based centrally,Positive
we had booked the affinia almost a year before going there and saw some of the poor reviews and were a little concerned our travel agent told us he was just back from the hotel spoke very highly of it saying it was very central clean and tidy so we stuck with it boy are we gladok the decor is a little dated but that must be the only negative thing that i can say about the place we were on the th floor great views and a massive balcony little cold to sit out but it was nice to get some fresh air first thing in the morning and to see the bright lights of the city late at nightthere is a fire house one side of the hotel and a police precinct the other but we rarely heard any noises from them must have been too tired we had a nice bathroom and kitchen area and the actual room itself was approx metres x metres the maid came every day and the place was always spotless leaving fresh towels and changed the bed linenthe staff were super friendly special thanks to maureen one of the concierges who went out of her way to help us book our seats on the return flight when the complimentary computer was downthe hotel is ideally situated directly across from penn station meaning subway access was right on the doorstep on top of penn station you have madison sq gardens arena a few blocks uptown and you have macys on th street continue up th avenue for times sq on nd street or go along th street for empire state building all within minutes of the hotelwe took a taxi from the airport jfk t there were ample taxis outside flat rate for any address in manhattan but there is a toll charge that is added onto this price plus tip next year we are going to try the long island rail road lirr airtrain combo taking us into penn station in minutes from the airport for approx each,Positive
stopped here for nights to celebrate my birthday and what a fabulous time we had the hotel was excellent our one bed suite was lovely and very clean as was the hotel overall didnt find it too noisy at all the staff were friendly and helpful and the overall decor was goodlocation wise this hotel is excellent we travelled from newark airport via train to penn station which was opposite the hotel it is just a couple of blocks from macys and a min walk to the empire state there are plenty of eateries nearby if you want a good value break this hotel comes highly recommended,Positive
it is a fantastic location and a superb clean room very large staff are very friendly too,Positive
we live in long island and i wanted to surprise my wife and two boys and with a christmas season weekend in manhattan and see the radio city music hall spectacular the hotel is perfect the location was perfect across from penn stationmsg so the commute was easy with the lirr check in was easy and the staff to a person was pleasant and helpful we were surprised by an upgrade to a one bedroom with a balcony the wife and i expected a balcony of x but it is x with a full set of patio furniture the cost is expensive but low for manhattan at the beginning of the holiday season you can tell the rooms are older but the furniture and amenities are completely clean and comfortable it may be older but definitely not seedy it is very well cared for we are considering another overnight trip in the spring and will definitely book the room herei noted one review of the hotel remarked about the street noise i recommend requesting a room on a higher floor but you have remember this is midtown manhattan not rural vermont you dont come here for the peace and quiet but we still felt like we could relax in the room as our own little enclave,Positive
booked through expedia was a decent price for the location not the cheapest but certainly not the most expensive looked at similar hotels in the area but booked this hotel on the basis of comments made by other guests the location is great especially if it is your st time in nyc a short walk from penn station so easy from newark airport hotel is located south of mid manhattan just across from madison square garden and only a short distance from macys everything touristy is within walking distance empire state times square central park etc and you can get the subway to lower manhattan really easily hotel was fine room was bigger than expected and the bed was really comfortable hotel is staring to show some sign of age but was kept really clean the hotel overall was better than we had expected would recommend for st timers to nyc,Positive
booked trip to new york as a birthday treat spent time reviewing with trip advisor before deciding on the affinia manhattan what a good decision that wasthe hotel has a charming old new york feel about it loved the mail chutes at the elevators it was exceptionally clean there was a lot of activity about the place which gave it a real buzzon entering the hotel the lobby is very impressive the speed of check in and the friendliness of the check in staff was reasurring we had room described as a quiet room and it was being at the back of the hotel although the decor was a bit dated it was spotlessly clean the kitchen two bathrooms the lounge could not fault it one bit the only fault i did have was the room was cold the windows are not double glazed and were draughty the window mounted air con did not help as they allowed the ingress of cold air the temp during our stay nov was below freezing unusally cold for this period this could be looked at during any future upgrade as for me i just turne the heaters up full blast did the trickall staff we friendly and helpful the concierge staff were excellent for information tickets and general guidfance for eateries they are an excellent point of referenceappreciated the luggage storage for guests who have checked out at but are not flying until late evening us it meant we could maximise our day and we didbest bits about new york all the usual plus the trip to katzs deli famous for that scene in when harry met sally for breakfast fred eggs sausage toast oj coffee and french fries at am we walked back through union sq flatiron to macys in a effort to burn off some calories definitely worthe the effort to find this placeblue smoke is a busy atmospheric pit barbq place it was in the guide book and we decided to check it out had to wait about an hour for a table worth it food was great huge ribs and massive amounts of brisket whilst at the bar it was good to see the bar manager refusing to serve a customer who he felt had had too much already good for himany how would i recommed the affinia manhattan to anyone going to nyc aboslutely,Positive
this hotel is great we booked a one bedroom suite through expedia as it was cheaper than booking directly with the hotel the rooms are massive with a huge bedroom and living room two bathrooms plenty of cupboard space and a kitchen fully equipped with full size fridge freezer oven and gas hobstaff were helpfu rooms very clean it has a coin operated laundry downstairs which is v useful if travelling with kidshotel is a min walk to macys and penn station mins to times sqaure mins to filenes basement at union squarebrilliant location we walked everywhere because pram and subway do not mixnearest places to get food jacks c store cheap and cheerful entrances on st and nd streets buy snacks bread drinks here sells everything apart form fresh food like fruit or veg whole foodswalk mins down th avenue away from macys expensive allorganic but very nice like waitrose it has fresh veg and fruit fish meat etc delis around the hotelvery very expensive but convenient if you just want to buy some milk or ice creamonly downside is the noise which is not the hotels fault centre of new york is going to be noisy the fire station next door is extra noisy but it did not wake us or the baby up at night i would definatly stay here again but would ask for a room on the opposite side of the building from the fire station to get a bit of distance from the sirens,Positive
my friend and i stayed here for nights the hotel was recommended to us i checked out reviews on this site and they were all very good so we were very excited about going to new york we booked a one bedroom suite and were glad of the extra space as we needed somewhere to store the shopping our first impression of the room was it was a bit dated and it could do with an update however the suite was very clean and the staff looked after us very well all the staff were very helpful and pleasant and that to me is important yes you could hear fire engines but you can here that in this country you cannot go to new york and expect it to be quiet we had a great time in nyc but think our expectations were a bit high if going for a short break it is impossible to do lots of shopping and sight seeing so its either one or the other we did find that all new yorkers were very helpful and nice but according to one of the taxi drivers it because of our accent all in all i would recommend this hotel if you want to be in the thick of it,Positive
well what an experience ladies all ages staying for nights at the affinia had previously contacted fayth at the hotel to express concerns over other reviews asked for a high floor because of the fire station underneath hotel and other requirements we had we arrived and they were expecting us and everything had been sorted as per our requirements very busy hotel so bear this in mind but rooms were very clean and tidy where is the threadbare carpet and noisy aircon people complianed about in past reviews we certainly had no complaints it is noisy but your in new york if you want peace stay in the country we are already saving to go back,Positive
i booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this site and was very pleased with my choice my wife and i spent three nights here on honeymoon and loved every minute the room we had was clean and spaciousthe bathroom was a little smallbut not to small to cause a problemthe kitchen was the samebut apart from using the fridgewhos going to cook when theyre in new york the location was excellent minutes walk from macys and minutes from times squarenot to mention the empire state just around the courner and numerous other shops and resturants on the door step we had much more fun shopping locallythan going to the outlet centre an hour awayand saw much more of the city doing so the staff were very friendly and helpfulespecially maureenwho was only too happy to help with anything we needed i wouldnt hesitate to stay there again as we had such a good time there,Positive

i booked this hotel during a special sale and chose this affinia hotel for its location i prefer to stay in this area than in times square loved being so close to the subway stations and to macys there were coffee places restaurants etc all around us we were supposed to get a bed studio and they were not ready by check in time so i offered to take a king bed instead and we were given a bedroom suite w bathroomsit was great our own nyc apartment i did hear some doors and voices at night but nothing horrible more like sounds in a regular apartment buildingthe staff were fantastic very friendly and helpful the room was very clean but the decor is worn bathrooms are small and can use a refurb which i think is coming i would definately stay here again,Positive

where do i start with this wonderful hotel after getting delayed with our flight and arriving at newark airport and phoning la quinta inn queens who me my wife and year daughter was meant to be staying booked months in advance la quinta told me our room was given away we took a train to penn station at pm saturday th oct it was raining harder than i had seen before we had nowhere to stay and cases with us we turned right out of penn station and went into st hotel we came to which was pennsylvania hotel who told us they had no room for us they did let my wife and child stay in reception while i went out into the night next stop affinia st street th avenue very posh looking but i planned on spending as much as it took for the night natalie was very helpful held the room while i went back to get my family it was over our budget but after a bit of discount we booked for the whole week and was well glad to have paid more than we planned they gave my daughter a teddy which she loves and sent up a bottle of red wine for my wife her bday no matter what time of day each and every member of staff was great and helpful we would definitely stay here again and i would say you pay for what you get god bless affinia you saved the day and made a trip that started off a nightmare into a wonderful relaxing stay the room was spacious also with a kitchen was cleaned daily and smelt so fresh and the view out of the window up to times square was amazing great location blocks from maceys and empire state and central to everywhere thank you affinia,Positive
we stayed for nights two familes of with teenage children the hotel is in a fantastic location just opposite penn station making it extremely easy to visit all the sightsthe hotel has very large rooms although some bathrooms are small but very clean and functional the beds are amazingly comfortable and with the facilities of a kitchen area this hotel is brilliant for a stay in new york a supermarket is next door to buy drinks etc really convenientwe did have a few problems with the admin on reception which was partially the error of our tour operator but apart from the time we had to stand at reception trying to resolve the problem it was sorted to our satisfaction and we would definately stay at this hotel again the conceriage staff were extemely helpful booking tickets restaurants etcthe hotel is close to the fire station and sirens can be heard during the night but after the st night you get use to it but it does seem very quiet when you return to the uk the hustle and bustle is all part of nycwe rate this hotel out of and would highly recommend it,Positive
we moved to the affinia from the over priced and very over rated w hotel thinking we were down grading much nicer more friendly spacious cheaper and altogether better than the w ask for a high floor to try and get away from the street noise disabled accommodation is much more spaciouscheck the bed size before going to your room as they range from small to massive double a helpful concierge but dont book theater or trips through them as they use agents who charge a big commission overall a good place to stay in ny and will go back there myself,Positive
my daughter and i have just returned from new york we stayed from th to th october at the affinia manhattan this hotel was part of a package deal with a travel agent and was also recommended by a friend who has previously stayed at the affinia dumonti did call ahead to arrange a suite with a view as we were in new york celebrating our birthdays this was not forthcoming but our suite was clean and tidy so i didnt want to make a fusswe had to share a huge bed but there was plenty of room for the both of us sheets were clean and we had clean towels everydaythe bathroom is tiny and a bit tired but for the amount of time you spend in there how much room do you need the concierge and hotel staff are polite courteous and very helpful the hotel is a stones throw away from all of the attractions you would wish to visit there is a deli two doors down which stocks all you could ask for and they too are friendly especially at am when you havent adjusted to the time change the noise is a bit annoying but if youve had a busy day you dont notice it when your asleepoverall i would rate this hotel as good friendly clean and tidyi am most surprised by the previous comments about cleanliness as the hotel was spotless the whole time we visited i have ocd so i would definitely know if something wasnt clean,Positive
i specifically booked a one bedroom suite with a double sized sofa bed as my husband and i were sharing the room with my mother my mother was to get the bedroom and we were to go on the sofabed when we checked in and went to the room we did have a one bed suite but it was tiny very worn and tired and only had a single person sofa bed after several phone calls and going back down to the front desk we finally got the room we booked however we had to move our baggage to our new room ourselves all of this made us late for our evening reservationsthis room was much larger and nicer however it is still worn and tired decor wise the kitchen areas are pretty old the heating controls are also extremley outdated as well my mother said the bed was very comfortable but the sofa bed was not the bathroom was on the small side but thats no suprise in ny in future i will stay in a smaller room in a nicer hotel,Positive
my boyfriend and i stayed at the affinia manhattan for nights in october we booked a studio suite and were not disapointedthe rooms are large and clean with plenty of room to relax after a long days shopping in manhattan not that youd be staying indoors for too longi had read most of the reviews on this website prior to booking and was slightly worried about the noise levels and the proximity of our room to the fire station and yes we were on the th floor overlooking the fire station room while there was some noise windows are only single glazed it was nothing to get too worried about we slept soundly and had no complaints the beds are fantastic and huge the shower room was quite small but adequate and very clean really i have no complaints about this hotel the staff couldnt have been nicer and we found the cleaning staff were very polite just to let you know on the last day when funds were running quite low and we needed to get to the airport in a hurry we were offered a town car from the hotel to the airport by the door man for a flat rate of this is cheaper that any taxi and far more comfortable the location is also fantastic you could not be more centrally located than here with madison square gardens just across the road i will stay at the affinia manhattan again and recommend it to anyone fantastic stay,Positive
we booked the affinia manhattan through hotelscom as it had a great deal going for a onebedroom suite for the same price as most other hotels could do for a double bed studio there were four of us so space was key but octobers a really expensive time to visit ny and so i tried every hotel bampb etc over the months leading up to our stay in the end it came down to affinia and another hotel but after speaking to people there was really no choice in the end we contacted the hotel directly to confirm our reservation and also to request an upgrade as three of the four travellers were celebrating birthdayswe all arrived around midnight and were checked in quickly however i was disappointed with the room we were on the th floor and as others have mentioned the room decor is extremely dated and the kitchen could well be straight out of any student flat the room was also very dark as the windows are either blocked by very noisy airconditioning units or they look straight out to the other buildings which tower above one of the sheets had a hole in it and basically the whole place was tired on the plus side there are two bathrooms which made it much easier for four of us and the pullout sofa was adequate although no linen had been left for it so it was mins and two phone calls at past midnight before we got theseas it was so late we didnt worry about the room as its fine for sleeping in after spending the next day touring the sights we spoke to reception about changing our room and i have to agree with other reviewers that will surname is large i think on reception is fantastic he listened to a small complaint we had dealt with it quickly and also arranged for us to move rooms the following day as the hotel was full that night we were moved to another onebedroom suite but this time with a kingsized bed and on the th floor so sunshine and a view of the river incidentally when we were meant to move the room wasnt ready and i got the runaround a bit from the person i was dealing with when i phoned reception again to ask when it would be ready i got will and he actually went up to the room himself to check on it before calling me back with an update it had similar decor to the first room but everything just slightly cleaner and fresher i would certainly recommend this room for the price we paidthe location is really great straight across the road from penn stationmadison square one block from maceys just a short walk to the empire state etcon the whole i would stay there again but only when requesting a higher level room which seem to be a bit better quality the staff were all friendly and i know for a fact we couldnt get anything remotely close to the size and location for a similar price at other hotels,Positive
my parents myself and a friend chose to stay at the affinia this summer we selected it because it appeared to be one of the best rated hotels on this site for the price range we wanted to pay with a good central location on entering the lobby eveything looked very impressive it was very spacious with seating a large tourist desk and nicely decorated we were checked in quickly and the staff seemed very nice we got in the lift up to one of the higher floors which we had requested due to the noise of the fire station nearby on stepping out of the lift we were a bit shocked by the state of the corridors it felt like a hospital very dingy grey and with worn out carpets the worst thing was that there was an incredibly musty smell throughout the corridor my friend and i were initally quite pleased when we entered the room because it was incredibly spacious with good sized double beds a round dining table tv kitchenette with a huge fridge sink etc our room had a view down to madison square gardens which was great the bathroom was disappointing as it was not at all clean there were long black hairs all over the floor in the bath and in the sink it was also incredibly dated and there was a cupboard which was filthy inside i felt quite ill seeing it the beds seemed clean and were very comfy and the rest of the room was also clean enough the next morning we headed out of the room and were instantly hit by the musty smell again it had got worse we were in new york when it was over degrees so we wondered if this was making it worse walking to the lift there were a lot of breakfast trays outside doors probably not helping the smelll but we overlooked this considering it was just after breakfast on returning to the hotel in the late afternoon we were shocked to see all the dirty breakfast trays were still sitting on the floor not impressive and not surprisingly the smell was worse still my parents requested a new room because unlike ours theirs smelt musty inside too they were given a master suite but were not best pleased when they found it was also musty they complained again and were told the hotel would be undergoing refurbishment soon on leaving the hotel we were wheeling our cases through the hallway and a huge laundry cart was left across the corridor as cleaners chatted to each other they saw us coming and could clearly see we couldnt get past with our cases but instead of moving the cart they continued to chat this meant i had to move the cart myself and after i did so they just smiled i dont go to a hotel to push laundry carts about overall we were disappointed because cleanliness is probably the first thing we want from a hotel good points were the location right by madison square gardens and penn station where we got the train to dc for the next part of our trip macys and times sq are also just a few blocks away the room size was excellent and would be good for a young family especially with the kitchenette etc the concierge were very helpful especially at the tourist desk as they helped us with theatre info and booking a very popular restaurant the restuarant attached to the hotel was wonderful and did the most delicous eggs benedict with salmon so its worth just going to the restaurant not cheap but delicousfor us the good points dont outweigh the bad and we will not be staying there again,Positive
pretty average overall good size room nice bath pleasant door man but dated lobby and corridors my studio had a good size kitchen and lots of utensils which is a good idea but the fridge was seriously noisy i had to turn it off to be able to sleep bed linen had very high synthetic content so i woke up every morning completely drenched in sweat one of the ladies at the information desk was very rude even by nyc standards you should be able to do better if you shop around,Positive
checked into the hotel and had booked a bedroomed suite for myself and my girlfriendscheck in process was a bit slowclerk advised they had just got a new system and they were having a few issues with itok so we remained patiantwe got given our keys and then dismissed from the desk with no intructions as to how to get to this roomafter a few questions were shown locations of the lifts and which floor we needed to be onwhen we got into the room we had bedroom suite with king bed and a living area with a chair and a desk and a seater sofathen there was a separate bathroom and kitcheni then thought ok so where are we all supposed to sleepi called the front desk and was attempting to explain that there seemed to be a bit of a prob as there was only bedthe girl i spoke to was not very helpfull at all and said well we advertise that the room only has either king or double bedswe had rq beds and had not been given thisi was advised that the hotel didnt have any of the suites with double beds avail so we couldnt move to another roomfinei accepted it was what it was a rq and this obviously on this occation could not be fullfilledshe advised that the sofa was in fact a sofa bed so of us would have to sleep on thati advised that there was no linen in the room so could they at least bring that and make up the bed for usthey brought the beddingwhich consisted of sheets and a itchy blanketthe bed sofabed had to be the most unfortable bed i have ever had the pleasure of sleeping ini slept on the floor with the sofabed cushions which was better than the matress on the sofabedthe rooms are also very dark with very little natural light which made it feel a little dingeyon the positive side the hotel was in a really good location and has a very good bar downstairs for your cocktailsdont let this reveiw put you off from staying here i go to nyc at least once a year and for the amount paid its a good base in which to explore the citybut i dont think i personally would return,Positive
stayed here for nights with my wife as a birthdayanniversary holiday we had a large room on the th floor with the biggest bed i have ever slept in plus a choice of pillows bathroom was small but had everything including a very powerful shower there was also a small kitchen with cooker fridge coffee maker etc but we only used the fridge for cool drinks neither of us wanted to cook on holiday even breakfast there was also a small store room for suitcases etc good sized wardrobe plenty of drawer of drawer space tv etc decor was perhaps a little tired but we only slep there so it was perfectly acceptablethe hotel is very well situated opposite madison square gardens there is a great bar restaurant across the road harringtons and a great bar called seven a few doors down from it both well worth a visitstaff were very courteous and helpful only slight drawback was a fire station on st and a police station on nd so sirens went all night but then this is new yorkall in all i would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone,Positive
very helpful doorman upon arrival and during entire days even though i am an ugly man room wasnt lavish but not out dated big roomy shower no tub huge closet internet at per day seemed steep but gives incentive to not surf or work in room some hotels still want per day for internet so it wasnt too bad very convenient to trains and excellent eateries from donut shops and cstores to elegant dining nice view of empire state building from our room i would stay again but not at rack rates worth about per night,Positive
the room was worn out bathrooms were too small and old kitchen was run down and appliances needed to be replaced i was afraid to turn on the stove lobby is great but rooms are not it is conveniently located to madison square garden but that is all it has going for it,Positive
it was my wifes th birthday the dollar was low and i wanted to do something special so off to new jersey and new york long beach island was great fantastic people and beaches great victorian guesthouse the barclays golf tournament was excellent fun my wife is a golf fanatic but i was saving the best for last a few nights in the centre of manhattan in a great hotel but no alas disapointment id booked a room with a terrace through the affinias quotal frescoquot summer promotion the terrace turned out to be a balcony overlooked by large chunks of the hotel and the bottle of champagne promised as part of the deal never turned up the room itself was tired out dated run down and very disapointing for the price the door to the balcony would not close properly and the kitchenette area felt as though it was from a students house the bathroom was tiny and also faded internet access was advertised at an exorbitant rate hotels of this theroretical as it turned out standard should offer wifi access for free staff were average the linked barrestaurant down stairs feels like it is from the s and not in a good wayi had asked for an early checkin as we had limited time in new york did not get it when we arrived early and had to wait ages for the bags to be stored we asked for a late checkout as our flight home was at pm did not get it and the house manager was borderline rudeif you want to stay in new york and want something special avoid this hotel do not spend extra on a balcony ooops sorry quotterracequot it is essentially pointless and useless for supping nonexistent champagne with the setting suni booked directly with the hotel and so received their feedback form by email and gave much trying to be positive criticism but noone got in touch after i sent it in overall very disapointed i shall not return next time i would stay in brooklyn get a better hotel with better facilities for the same or less money and enjoy the walk in over the brooklyn bridge it is a shame that the th trip ended like this,Positive
we stayed at the affinia manhattan for nights in sepember we had a studio suite with double beds the room was not quite as large as i thought it would be after looking at the photos on this site but since we were only there long enought to sleep it wasnt a big deal the room was very nice and very cleanthe kitchenette was very nice also we puchased a gallon of milk and some other items and saved a little money by having breakfast there every morningwe had a room on the th floor and aside from the occasional fire sirens and horn honking it was very quiet after the first night you get used to the noise of the citythe staff was very courteous and helpful housekeeping was also very good they even cleaned our dirty dishes for usthe location is wonderful my son thought it was very cool to be staying right across the street from madison square garden there are subway stations every where and it is only about a minute walk to times squarei would definately recommend the affinia to other people and would stay here again if im ever in new york again,Positive
my friend and i stayed here last weekend what a perfect location we were within walking distance to so many thingsattractions restaurants theaters subways etc we were on the th floor and had absolutey no problem with any noise from the streets i fully expected it to be noisy i mean youre in the middle of manhattan but it was very quiet never heard other people in their rooms either our suite was adorable and the kitchenette was very useful all of the staff that we interacted with were courteous and helpful would stay there again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to anyone,Positive
we stayed at the affinia manhattan for nights in early september i originally booked a suite but when we arrived we had actually been upgraded to a one bed suite on the nd floor which was a lovely surprise particularly as we were in new york to celebrate my girlfriends th birthday our room had great views of th avenue and madison square garden it comprised a large living area fully equipped kitchen two bathrooms a bedroom with queen size bed and large roof terrace the room was huge and so comfortable that we didnt want to leave it even on the th floor we did experience some street noise from the taxis and fire engines racing down th avenue but to us it encapsulated what life is like living in a busy city and we thought it actually added to the experience of being in manhattan it certainly didnt cause us any sleepless nights as other people have said the hotel is situated in a great location opposite penn station and within easy walking distance of times square the empire state building and macys a great base to explore the city fromwe found all the hotel staff to be extremely friendly and helpful everyone that we encountered did everything they could to ensure that we had a pleasant stay and it left a very favourable impression two stand out members of the affinia team were maureen concierge who helped us to purchase tickets book trips and generally provided a wealth of useful tips and information and will front desk who when i did make a relatively minor compliant about our room resolved the problem very quickly and efficiently thanks for those complementary engagement cocktails by the way will we ate in the hotel restaurant niles on one occasion and were really impressed with the quality of the food and the surroundings we also ordered room service a couple of times again the food was good and arrived promptly overall we were really impressed with the affinia manhattan so much so its a hotel that we would definitely return to in the future,Positive
the affinia manhattan is more like an apartment rather than a hotel you just get that homely feeling as soon as you walk into the lobbythe hotel is in a very good location at the south end of midtown amp right across the road from madison square garden amp penn stationthe room we stayed in was very clean amp had a small kitchen which came in very handy the room was very comfortable amp there was a pretty good restuarant amp bar downstairs next to the lobbyjust like most hotels in nyc it is a bit pricey for what you are getting,Positive
very nice hotel all the staff were very friendly towards uswe had a studio room and were expecting something that you could just walk around the bed but our room was huge for manhattan rooms and the pricemaureen on the concierge desk was especially helpful on several occasions for booking tickets and general advice she knows her stuffvery well placed hotel in terms of transport linkswe had emailed in advance to ask for a room on a high floor and are needs were catered towould recommend going to ginger house for some food if you like chinese food its across the street and down one block i think very good foodwould easily go back to this hotel again,Positive
i stayed at the affinia during the labor day weekend it was myself and girlfriends we stayed in one of the bedroom suites with a kitchen and bathrooms we were all very impressed and enjoyed our stay all nights the staff was friendly and the beds were comfortable but mostly the location was perfect the rooms are a little tired and could use some new paint but they were equiped with flat screen tvs and very roomy i am a travel agent and i wont be afraid to sell this property to my clients see you next year affinia,Positive
this was our second stay we drove into city and were met by a wonderful gentleman who took over our valet parking last stay we came by train to penn station which is across the street the staff as before were polite professional and our reservation was exactly what we requested our room was a one bedroom suite you felt as if you were staying in a luxury apartment in manhatten kitchen with reg size fridge bedroom large with soft sheets and lots of pillows there is also a pillow menu if you want to try something unique we were on the floor quiet except for the occational honk or siren i loved it the hotel is convienient to shops resturants and a short walk to times square the affinia is an excellant choice for the price next year we plan on a family vacation for our twenty aged children and know we will feel welcomed and have a magnificant time one last thought the affinia has a very large professional staff that will make you feel like a special guest,Positive
the affinia is well positioned in manhatten and close to a subway station on th street or at penn station a few yards away the hotel is comfortable with spacious rooms and helpful staff so why not at least stars the down side is noise previous reviewers have mentioned the nearby fire station but the big continuous issue is the huge metal sheet that all traffic rumbles over as it passes one side of the hotel so even on the th floor the noise was obvious night and day so by all means use this hotel but insist on a high level room and one that doesnt face onto street level,Positive
we stayed in the affinia manhattan over labor day weekend and were thoroughly satisfied with all aspects of the hotel we got a rate for approximately per night and thought that given this price the affinia really fit the bill among its peers at this price levelthe location is just prime easy to get to and from the hotel to basically all locations in the city and the area that the hotel is in provides for ample looking aroundthe hotel itself is a nice building although a little different not sure it has always been a hotel it seems like a big bank lobby or something similar but it is inviting and welcoming nonetheless staff was good and accomodatingwe had the smallest room a queen it was clean thorughout the bed was comfy the ac worked and it was quiet nothing that outstanding about the room but for the heart of the city it was really quite good size and the bed really was comfortablethe exercise room is small but surprisingly well equipped we really enjoyed this amenity and the fact that it is open hoursoverall you cant go wrong staying here very good spot for a weekend trip,Positive
the entrance was grand the staff were friendly and helpful willing to help you the bed and pillows were great woke up every morning feeling good i wanted to take a pillow home with me we were on the rd floor which was quiet the bedroom suite with a queen size bed was very comfortable and had it own full bathroom my brother slep in the hidabed in the living area which also had a full bathroom which he said it was also conforatable great location across from madison square garden and penn station a block away from macys and blocks away from empire state building i would recommend this hotel i would recommend this hotel,Positive
affina manhattan right across from madison square garden and so a great central place to stay staff really friendly rooms huge we got double beds when we booked our twin with fridge to keep our drinks and breakfast cool in cannot fault it and would definately stay again,Positive
had a good if exhausting week in the affinia manhattan not cheap by any means and this room in other countries would command half the price when i mentioned the noise the guy behind the reception desk burst into laughter and said you didnt expect noise in nyc i did but i hadnt really given it much consideration this hotel is built over a fire station the engines go out with full sirens and horns or times every night we were on the th floor but felt the noise would have been similar if we had been in a sleeping bag in the fire station itself to reduce this ask for a very high floor or above the size of the room was actually fine we had two double beds just adults my daughter and myself i chose this hotel because of the availability of a kitchenette in the room and the fridge amp coffee maker proved very useful also a couple of nights when we were tired we bought a takeout from the chinese just across the road and brought it into the room ate in bed so having plates amp cutlery was useful too bathroom a little run down tiny bath just a shelf that you can perch on if you need to couldnt really actually have a bath shower above worked fine slightly grubby tiles needed updating a bitdirectly across the road from madison square garden the location is brill walking distance couple of blocks yds maybe to macys macys is just a fantastic shop close to the hop on hop off bus stop too so cant fault the location at all maureen on the concierge desk is worth waiting for if shes busy she knows her stuff and will make great suggestions couldnt have been more helpful someone should give her a pay risethe airconditioning in the room worked very well room was icy cold but it was actually a huge clunking beast stuck into the glass of the window the size of a fridge and if you closed the curtains it stopped the airconditioner so you were cool all night but had the noise and the early light coming straight into the room or you closed it up and sweated to death but it was a bit darkerso in summary im not sorry that i chose the affinia i think its way expensive and way noisy but as the guy on reception said this is new york what did you expect,Positive
we stayed at the affinia manatttan from th august nd september although the hotel was obvsiously built many years ago the rooms are light and airy we had a large suite on the th floor the room was spotlessly clean and our only criticism was that the shower in the bathroom was very small and considering the size of the suite it certainly could have been bigger without losing much space the only other drawback was that the room was noisy due to the fire station along the road and lorries collecting the garbage in the middle of the night plus the general hustle and bustle of new york so we were not able to get a peaceful nights sleep all of the staff were very friendly and both the reception ladies and gentelmen were charming and attentive and also responded to any requests efficiently the concierege staff were also exceedingly helpful and the doormen and chambermaids were cheerful and obligingall in all we were delighted with our stay at the hotel it was our third time in new york and each time we have stayed at a different hotel not by choice necessarily but because of the offers available on the second occasion we stayed at the astoria and both my husband and i feel that the affinia manhattan was superior in each departmentthank you guysjuliette and gerald bougourd,Positive
my wife and i stayed here for days from september it was our wedding anniversary so they gave us a corner room on the th floor with a balcony overlooking th avenue and msg the staff were excellent the room was huge and the location is perfect not the quietest hotel but hey youre in new york what do you expect the affinia is a great place to stay if you want to in the middle of it all niles restaurant was also a great place to eat and relax,Positive
we had a great first few days in new york staying at this hotel we had two suites between four of us with large comfy beds a small kitchenette and small but clean bathroom room size was good though windows and carpets pretty grubby we were happy enough initially particularly with the location right opposite penn station near empire state times square etcour room was number ninth floor it was noisy from the fire engines opposite and the constant car horns but we learned to put up with thathowever my daughter and i were being bitten on our lower legs over the days but we didnt know what it was until the th day when i found a flea on hopping across the white towel in the bathroom we caught it and killed it but by this time i had eight bites on my lower legs and my daughter had we quietly told reception who at first were nice about it kept saying the hotel had never had such a problem and they were sure it was not a flea though pets are permitted we produced the flea and it was sent away for analysis they offered us a change of room as if they were doing us a huge favour we didnt want to move with only two nights left but eventually agreed if they moved all four of us to adjacent rooms our new room was inferior smaller beds inaccessible mirror darker and noisier being three floors down we asked for some sort of compensation and from that moment the staff we were dealing with became less than friendly or rather sarcastically friendly they eventually and reluctantly agreed to knock one night off the bill but left us feeling it was our fault and that we must have brought the fleas with usa quick search on trip advisor reveals that a number of other guests have been bitten while staying there so beware they never did report back on the analysis of said flea to be honest if they had done the decent thing and accepted the problem as theirs and offered reasonable compensation without us having to ask for it i would not be writing this been home days and still itching,Positive
we only had one night at this hotel on our way back to uk but it was excellent i got a very good price for a sunday night inc tax very clean and spacious excellent location only negative comment would be that the bathroom in our studio suite was miniscule we are both fairly small but hit the wall when showering but that did not detract from lovely room and kitchenette wish we could have stayed longer,Positive
we are just back from a very enjoyable night stay at the affinia manhattan the location is excellent so near macys its dangerous for the credit card only a short walk from time square right opposite madison sq gardenstaff were very helpful and friendly rooms are spacious and clean beds very comfy our bathroom was a little small but very clean decor is a little dated but rooms aare immaculately clean,Positive
having recently visited new york thought i would share our thoughts on the affinia manhattan its great not only is it in a central place over the road from penn station and madisson square gardens but also just a short walk to anywhere for example broadway top of the rock central park but its very quiet and the room are very accomodating and comfortable basically what more could you want nothing seemed to be a problem we were very impressed and would recommend it to anyone wanting a decent place to stay we didnt eat at the hotel but took advice from others on this site and ate at places like the tic tok cafe which is just round the corner,Positive
online research led me to the affinia manhattan and i was not disappointed my mother and i spent days in nyc at the beginning of sept we went to shop see some shows and enjoy the city this was not our first trip to nyc but it was our first to the affinia manhattan the location was perfect for all our purposes walk to theatre columbus circlecentral park empire state building macys and whole foods market the subway station to all other points is practically outside the hotel front door and the neighbourhood was delightful and safe we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite at check in which was more than enough room for the two of us we had a full kitchen which was great for a quick and cheap breakfast and any leftovers from the huge portions served at many restaurants the bed bedding pillow menu and two bathrooms were exceptional we heard very little street noise from our room and no interior noise the rooms were clean though not the most modern and could use an update the staff was always friendly quick to respond helpful and polite we never felt pressured to tip or use a particular service we were allaround very pleased with our stay we would both stay here again but are also interested in checking out the other affinia hotels in nyc,Positive
my boyfriend and i stayed at the affinia manhattan for nights last month we had a one bedroomed suite on the th floor our room was located at the side of the building was which quiet and drowned out road noise the only downside was it was very dark as had little natural lightthe room was clean and spacious only downside was in bed we got a lot of noise from next doors toilet and shower which was a nuisanceon the plus side the location of this hotel was fantastic about mins walk straight up the road gets you right in the middle of times square the underground is just across the road would consider this hotel again but would like a different room,Positive
this hotel has a ver grand lobby and a brilliant cocktail bar the staff are very friendly and are only to happy to help should you need anything the hotel provides tea and coffee on a morning the rooms are very basic and are a lot different to those pictures on this site which must be ultra superior rooms however as we were hardly there much it didnt matter too much the bed was very comfy which was the most important thing owing to the ammount of walking we did the bathroom was a bit dated and the toilet did brake but it was fixed by morning the hotel is situated is a very good location opposite penn station and madison square gardens close to the shopping districts and attractions it would have been nice to have a view of the the area but we had an air conditioning unit in our window looking out onto another building on the whole though it was good,Positive
had a terrific stay at the affinia manhattan hotel the staff were fantastic in every part of the hotel check in was the best i have ever had very straight forward we were fortunate to have a very charming gentleman book us in the luggage boy was just out of this world with his attention to detail he is a treasure for any hotel the staff at the restaurant were brilliant let us not forget pete and dave from the bar two exceptional barmen the room was terrific we had a view looking straight up th avenue this was amazing i would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone it is very central the concierge desk has fantastic staff if every hotel was like this it would be brilliant keep up the good work,Positive
room hotel location staff and service were all good to great stayed for a week with our two young sons amp and it would be a very hard place to beat for the money our rate was night for a spacious tworoom suite with a small but nice and clean kitchen which allowed us to make several breakfasts and one dinner in our room saving a ton for a few restaurant splurge nights fly into newark take the air train kids ride free on weekends almost to the hotels front door you arrive at penn station a block away then buy a weeklong subway pass for per adult again young kids ride free and you can easily get to anywhere in all five burroughs without ever needing a cab we didnt try room service or the hotels restaurant next door so cant comment on that but otherwise this hotel exceeded our expectations on all counts highly reccomended and in case you havent been to manhattan times square is about a tenminute walk north of this hotel the empire state building is only a couple blocks away and the flatiron building is about a ten minute walk south the hotel is right next to madison square garden which sits atop penn station and a two short blocks from macys,Positive
my husband and i had wonderful nights in this hotel great position right across the road from madison sq garden the service was a and the rooms very roomy and clean it is obviiously an old hotel but that didnt take away from the overall service and cleaniliness of the hotelwe would reccommend this hotel even the door man angel was a great help and always happymarg galt australia,Positive
myself and my mum stayed in this hotel on a shopping break for a week the hotel is in a great location directly opposite madison square garden and penn station it is a short walk to macys ladies mile etc the location is one of the best things about this hotel it was easy to walk to times square about minutes comfortable walkwe booked a room with two double beds in which was nice it was a reasonable size room small bathroom and a little kitchen which had everything you would expect in it there is air conditioning which is in the window alongside one of the beds and if you close the curtains you dont get any of the benefit from the air con we were on the th floor it was quite noisy i would recommend asking for higher there is a fire station within the same block of the hotel and everytime they go out on a call the sirens are on it is a very noisy citythis hotel benefits from a concierge desk right in the centre of the lobby away from reception so if you have a question you dont have to stand in line with everyone waiting to check in and out maureen on concierge is far and away the best member of staff we were able to book theatre tickets bus tickets tour tickets etc all with her we got recommendations for restaurants tours and everything else you would expectin summary a good hotel with everything you need in a fabulous location ask for a high floor if you plan to sleep at all but this is ny,Positive
we stayed here for a wedding despite the reduced wedding rate the price was high and service average the location near penn station is excellent the restaurant breakfast is poor however the room was large and had a kitchen,Positive
unbelievable stay would return again the comfort and professionalism was superb loved having a choice of different pillows,Positive
stayed here for nights with friends there was of us we had a junior suite between of us and the other had a studio place was very central to everything thought it was a little pricey cost us euro each our room was a little cold when we complained there was some one up to fix it straight away found them to be very helpful the door man is so nice very chatty the total cost for the of us to stay was euro with no breakfast all in all had a great time in new york cant wait to go back but wil be looking for something a little bit cheaper,Positive
stayed for nights great location in the middle of the city blocks from macys blocks from time square minuite walk staff was nice and energetic though they do need to work on their direction giving skills the bathroom was a bit small for my taste but it was clean the bed was huge very comfortable and if you sign up on their website and tell them you want certain amenties its there waiting for you in the hotel room,Positive
second time to stay here was a bit secptical after reading the reviews on this websiteemailed amy the customer service manager and got quick reponse and room request was grantedstaff at main desk and lobby very friendly rooms clean and spacious would have no hesitation to stay again i am planning to return for my next visit location is great remember new york is noisy you will not find rooms on the main avenues that are quiet,Positive
arrived after having been travelling for over hours checkedin with nino who started to explain ny then said come back tomorrow when you are awake and i will go through it then with youlovely rooms with two bathrooms kitchen fully fitted with crockery etcstayed nights lots of help from nino and others had room service from niles as well as breakfast which was lovelyon last day was concerned about cost of getting to newark to collect car angel the doorman set it all up with a driver and a lincoln town car good job as we had started our shopping early it was a fixed rate with an excellent driverthroughly recommend it and we will be back,Positive
just returned from staying nights at the affinia manhatten i went with my sisters and no one had any complaints about our stay there the rooms were spacious bathrooms spacious beds were absolutely wonderful staff pleasant i would like to especially thank maureen one of the conceiges she was most helpful and very pleasant i would highly recommend this hotel we were on the th floor and the noise level was not a problem,Positive
great location no personal service though hotel was going through change at the time so i can forgive that rooms very comfortable,Positive
i used priceline to book this trip i was not expecting anything outstanding wow was i wrong everyone associated with the affinia was amazing they were helpful and polite i average two trips a year to nyc with my children and we have stayed in some really nice places that cost alot of money and we have stayed in some dives that have cost alot of money but our stay at affinia was the best ever we will be staying at this hotel for all future trips the location the service the rooms were all great i would highly suggest this hotel to anyone wanting the best of the best thank you to all of the staff at affina,Positive
we had a fabulous stay at this hotel with our teenage children it is in a fantastic place for getting around new york its close to subway stations and is walking distance from the empire state building the staff were excellent all of them on our first night my husband and i had a terrible problem with a very noisy and inefficient air conditioning unit in our room we went to the desk to complain and within an hour our unit had bee replaced by a new one the concierge was brilliant really helpful and friendly the only reason i am not giving this a five star rating is because the room we had was small as was our kids it seems that all rooms that end in are small and quite dark but perfectly acceptable also the decor is all a bit tired saying this i would definitely recommend it as a destination,Positive
location of the hotel was fantastic a couple of minutes from macys diagonally opposite madison square gardens and within easy walking distance of both times square and the empire state building we had a corner room which meant that the view was straight down th avenue and times square with all the lights and glitz traffic noise was not great though with the local fire station in the same block and the expected honking of horns having said that it is to be expected and my kids the wife and i were so shattered by the end of each day we slept through most of itthe view from the window more than made up for all of itthe hotel staff were soso not as cheery or welcoming as concierges around europe but again that is a new yorker trait we found the same grouchy demeanour from most new yorkers in the shops ranging from disinterest to rude particularly if you gave any impression of not wanting to buybut new york is an amazing place and one i will visit again for certain it is so buzzing and even in the days we were there there was so much i still wanted to do but the kids were too young the location of the hotel was perfect for us also and we would not hesitate to return despite the lukewarm reception,Positive
having selected the hotel after reading reviews and for the locality i emailed the hotel prior to going as my husband really wanted a view of the empire state kyle emailed back that he had sorted it out and when we arrived we had a room on the th floor with a balcony and a view of the empire state the bed was the best ive slept on and although both the room and bathroom were small they were adequate as we were hardly ever ini would certainly recommend the affinia to others thankyou for making that part of our holiday special,Positive
im terribly late in reviewing this hotel but i did want to say that we had a great stay we were given a corner room it was huge the beds were probably one of the most comfortable ive stayed in loved the pillow menu the staff was helpful as well i really dont have a bad thing to say about this place,Positive
fantastic went here with my mother on the th march and stayed for a week it was my first time in ny and i have to say the location was bang on my friend and her mother stayed here for a couple nites with us too the room that my mam and i had was big very big by ny standards we had a little kitchette and ensuite also and a big closet we were floors up and our room looked out on th ave i am going back and i will def stay here it is just so central we stayed on a bed only basis but had breakfast in the hotel on our last morning and talk about a choice for breakfast the bar was always a hub of activity in the evening very close to macys minutes walk highly recommend,Positive
stayed here for my th bday got studio king suite for great rate very nice and big room hardwood floors and balcony comfortable bed and great shower pressure elevators in hotel one was big and the other was barely enough for people with luggage bellman and front desk staff were great and helpfull food starbucks train whole foods central park all within steps of hotel overall this is great hotel and plan on staying here again in the future,Positive
we stayed one night to celebrate a special birthday we were surprised by an upgrade to a penthouse suite due to a cancellation the suite was amazing clean very spacious nice amentities everything we could need and if not the staff was always willing to help with anything you would want or need the location was awesome across the street from central park and time warner bldgthe staff at columbus was young attentive courteous friendlymore than helpful and very professional the staff at the hotel made our visit better than expected and we will definately returnwe didnt try the hotel restaurant but did have room servicecontinental breakfast and it was on time and very satisfying great place to start and end your visit in nycthere is a store right at the corner if you forgot anything or want cold drinkssnacksetc,Positive
i stayed here for one night we haggled the price for the room and he put it down by about the hotel room is lovely we got a king roomreally clean and big loads of room big bathroom with bath very comfortable bed tv ipod dock wardrobe would recommend this hotel nice and quiet reception wer really nice its a small hotel but conteporary design but great roomwe had breakfast the next morning in the restaurant and was really nice great location,Positive
while the contemporarystyled standard rooms here are small and lack the chairs desk and dressers one might expect the hotel makes up for it with a perfect location for lincoln center the theater district and central park from the smiling and talkative doorman to the speedy check in and check out receptionist to the friendly and capable housekeeper the staff were all way above average,Positive
great hotel very nice employees with a modern s s design and next to central parkfor a first time in ny its the best place to stay uptown,Positive
we booked this hotel on quikbookcom at an unbelievable rate of night or nights before our arrival everything else we looked at was over and this turned out to be the best place weve ever stayed in in new york our room was called a pod room which means there is a bedroom and bathroom no seating area and no desk but were never in the room anyway so it was perfect as you can see by the many photos here the rooms are clean stylish modern we loved that there is a starbucks right next door and the columbus circle subway station a major subway stop with many intersecting lines is right across the street its across the street from the time warner center for highend shopping all this plus the low rate adds up to a perfect new york hotel,Positive
great location beautiful room however it needed a desk to work onthe breakfast is served in the japanese restaurant and was not at the standard that i expected,Positive
i recently stayed in new york and had originally booked this hotel going by some of the reviews on here but still a bit sceptical about the room size this was a personal trip but i was hoping to use the hotel and add it to my list for accommodating my business clients and staff anyway about a week before my stay i found a much better deal so decided to cancel the booking i rang the hotel from the airport on way to another trip and everything was sorted or i so i thoughti got back after my stay to find an email thanking me for my stay and asking me to fill in a questionnaire i checked my credit card and sure enough ive been charged for the first night so i email the hotel was told blankly that i would not be refunded because i didnt keep the cancellation number who the hell keeps these anyway i expected the hotel to send me an email confirming my cancellation but nothing arrived like i said i was at the airport and wouldnt be able to check until i returnedso if you have to stay there be careful when making your booking who knows what the dodgy booking system might dowhilst in ny i called into the hotel after reading about the sushi restaurant obviously before i found that id been ripped off it was very overpriced and there is a much nicer sushi bar a few doors away the hotel is not actually on columbus circle at all but a side street and the view is of the back of a highrise shopping centre and its more than a walk to time square theres much better to be had in ny and in the other hotel i had a room on the th floor with a view of the empire state building for less money,Positive
me and my boyfriend have stayed in a standard queen room for two nights rooms were well decorated in a contemporary minimalist style with great artwork on the walls the size of the room is not big but standard for ny room itself was very clean designer toiletries in the bathroom pity they didnt have a trash can in the room only in bathroom i wish they could improve on the lighting it was a bit dark we found location very convenient right next to subway and huge shopping center with whole foods where we got our breakfast there was a sushi restaurant downstairs which looked very good and very busy every night cabs were easy to catch right next to the hotel staff was very polite and helpful as well as good looking overall we enjoyed our stay,Positive
this is a good hotel in a great location with extremely friendly and helpful staff i wouldnt t think that would make a difference but it does the hotel staff definitely make this place worth a try,Positive
my husband booked this hotel in jan for my th birthday in aug he booked a queen superior amp also put on the booking form that it was for a quotspecial birthdayquot and could we have a room with a nice view when we arrived we were allocated room it was the smallest room i have even seen and looking out of the very small window the only view was of a very large white soil pipe running down the middle of the window when i challenged the porter as to what grade of room it was he said it was a quotpodquot room we explained that we had booked a queen superior he suddenly changed his mind and said yes it was a queen superior we did get moved to a better room after complaining to the front desk still no nice view and certainly no up grade as lots of other people seemed to get in the reviews in the days we were there only of the elevators worked amp we were on the th floor apart from the above the hotel is in a great location and was clean amp tidy we felt the hotel was all style amp no substance it all looks very classy on the web site,Positive
i was persuaded to stay here by my boss instead of the parker meridien as she counts it as one of her favorite hotels in nyc i came for meetings and stayed for the weekend with my partner i thought this was a charming hotel with wellchosen decor and amenities from the midcentury furniture in the lobby to the furcovered walls of the elevators my room was cozy with teak walls great magazines a small freestanding wardrobe and bluetiled bathroom complete with kiehls bath products the location is right across the timewarner center and columbus circle subway stop time square is a few blocks away as well as some great restaurants i would definitely stay here again,Positive
i first stayed at columbus in november of not too long after it opened and enjoyed it very much since then i have had occasion to return to it a few times but havent entered a review so thought i would provide current thoughts my most recent stay was from july this year virtually all of my bookings there have been through quikbook for under a night in a pod or queen room i dont spend much time in my manhattan hotel rooms outside of sleeping so im pretty easy to please on things like having enough space to swing a cat and tend to focus more on things like a comfortable bed overall cleanliness a quiet place to put your head down and a clean and functional bathroom columbus has never disappointed on any of these fronts on any stay it has quite simply become my hotel of choice in manhattani cant say enough about the location time warner shops restaurants and bars and one bknbrx subway stop literally right across the street a bknqns subway stop around the corner and central park as close as you can get for the money im not such a lover of cities that i can do without green space so while i might go shopping in soho i aint staying there the hotels own bar is a nice place to gather troops before starting out or for a nightcapstaff continues to be helpful and ive had only one negative checkin experience in the nature of no room being available when i arrived and the promised minutes becoming but this is definitely the exceptiontheres nothing yet that has been serious enough to send me elsewhere,Positive
columbus was disappointing during my recent twoweek stay i travel as a consultant to nonprofits and my clients understandably want to keep hotel expenses reasonable which columbuss rates do accomplish i am content with a hotel that falls far short of luxury but columbus did not meet basic needs the rooms are small including quotsuitesquot which surprisingly are not really suites but rather single rooms like all others my room reminded me of a college dorm room it had no closet but did have a small armoire regrettably not deep enough to hold a clothes hanger back to front and wide enough to hold very few shirts or suits inquiring at the front desk i was alerted that two cupboards were built into one side of the base of the bed which i had not seen since a duvet hung over them this helped but it meant i had to get on my knees to retrieve anything i was a single traveler i cannot imagine how more than one person could negotiate this room of course the hotel finds plenty of space for its inroom minibar food and souvenir concessions that duvet by the way was not clean showing organic remnants of a previous guest and was finally laundered or replaced on the fourth day despite my earlier requests the duvet is the only bedcovering theres no sheet so you sleep under the duvet which for me became unbearably hot or nothing i soon realized this was not such a bad thing because the noise level is high especially from staff in the hallwaysand i was not even near the elevator the only effective strategy is to turn the ac way down so it runs as much as possible to drown out the noise at night and then its so cold in the room that the duvet is perfect a large roach or waterbug ground into the carpet remained for several days after my arrival and impossible to miss until i forced the cleaning person to deal with it as i stood by and watched the cleaning staff was invariably pleasant one day however i returned to the room at in the afternoon to find them just starting on my room which was inconvenient the room telephone received calls but i could not dial out or retrieve messages that were left though they announced their presence through the blinking light a manager came to the room to try to fix it and confessed that the hotels whole phone system was quota total messquot in two weeks the phone was never fixed one night i called the front desk via my cell phone to arrange an early wakeup call the next morning and the call arrived as requested the next morning after that someone from the staff banged on my door at the same early hour shouting that this was my wakeup call but my phone wasnt working unfortunately that was to have been my sleepin day room was quite dark even with all the lights on full as the window gave on to a deep airshaft that let in little light bathroom was to the usual smallhotel standard hallways are very narrow and are made more difficult to navigate by roomservice trays which spend entire days without being collected sometimes these sit in stairwells which must surely be a safety violation the inroom information book says they deliver the ny times every morning but instead they delivered the ny post an entirely different species of newspaper i pointed this out at the front desk and although the staffperson seemed not to grasp what i was saying they did deliver the times along with the post the next day and most days thereafter frontdesk staff was generally cold and unhelpful concierge was pleasant and doormen were eager and cheerful entry hallway leading from lobby to elevators is kept very dark sexy and mysterious i guess but i found it impossible to see when entering from the brightness of the street often via a small homeless encampment outside and guests were forever colliding with each other in that dark hallway columbus cultivates a chic and highattitude veneer but does not address the essentials of what a hotel must minimally provide internet is per day i might expect a hotel that tries to trade in trendiness would offer it for free as so many now do they do respond somewhat to nudging still for a twoweek stay it grew depressing and i cannot recommend this hotel,Positive
arrived tuesday th for a night stay i had booked what i thought was a good deal via quickbook for a studio suite worked out at taxes i was to very pleasantly suprised to be upgraded to a huge duplex loft suite that had great view over time warnerroom had two flat screen tvs great shower and bathroom facilitiesvery comfy bed and pillows and a great fridge and freezer with microwave and hob if you need itso great start to a good breakthe location for uptown is superb mta just cross over the road only a few minutes to walk to central park and minutes across to th avenue and its many and numerous shopswhole foods in the basement of time warner building just across the road is good to buy grocery for breakfasthotel staff were very friendly and kept good humour in some very unseasonal wet weather in new york good recommendation for lunch from staffreally enjoyed my stay at columbus and would be very happy to return,Positive
we booked via quikbook for a night stay in june the quikbook add said free upgrade so upon arrival at around check in from we were told tersely to say the least that no room was ready there would be a minute wait and there were no upgrades as they hotel was fullwe waited no apology or drinkanything offered patiently for about minutes and finally feeling pretty ignored we questioned whether our room was ready quotdont knowquot came the reply quotthe hotel is full you knowquot since when has a hotel been full been the guests fault huffily we are given an upgrade amazing since the hotel was full presumably someone who was late got downgraded thenonly complaint about the room was that the view was of a grotty back of an apartment block but then we werent expecting a panaroma beds were very comfyon the plus the location is great the reception and attitude we got on arrival really soured things for us i wouldnt stay again unless it was an exceptionally good deal,Positive
i got a great deal on priceline for a night it was very clean and nicely designed rooms are small but who spends time in their room in nyc heated bathroom floors were a great plus as were the kiehls products staff was very friendly and helpful the best thing that this hotel is its location it is located literally right next to a subway stop a b c d the hotel restaurant blue ribbon has very good sushi,Positive
first off let me tell you that my husband and i have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars in the hollywood roosevelt over the past several years we lived in hollywood during most of that time and we encouraged many many of our friends to stay there while visiting us in la we also spent several nyes and multiple memoriallabor days with you since we moved from la we chose you to stay when business brought us back to la we love the roosevelt hotel we have always been treated with the utmost respect and in fact were recently upgraded when we checked in for a night stay in based on this love we booked the six columbus via a travel agent to celebrate my husbands th birthday this past weekend for a studio suite at the rate of nt although there were cheaper rooms available at your hotel we decided to spend a bit more since it was my husbands birthday we were so sorely disappointed that i must bring it to your attention in the hope that it will be addressed we arrived in nyc at approx pm on wed june rd and travelled to the six columbus which took approx hrs by the time we got our luggage our plan was to check in freshen up and then meet up with friends for a dinner reservation at the gramercy park rose room for dinner at pm when we arrived we were informed that the front staff already knew about deans birthday and that we were being checked into room quota very nice roomquot when the bellman took us up to the room we were disappointed to discover that the room was not in any way a quotsuitequot but a regular albeit nice hotel room we contacted the front desk and the person assured us that the room was in fact a quotstudio suitequot even though there was no suite area whatsoever and the room did not match the room photos displayed on the website we had booked through www newyorkluxuryhotelscom even the bellman who brought our bags confirmed that the room was not considered a quotstudio suitequot but a king superior room we felt hustled our first and stereotypical experience of nycwe contacted the travel agent with whom we had booked and that agent began the process of straightening things out and ultimately relocating us to another hotel all the while time marched on as we attempted to solve our problem on my husbands birthday in the hope of making a timely dinner reservation in nyc in the interim the lovely bellman came up and informed us that the manager costas had quotupgradedquot us to a king suite the bellman took us down to room which was the exact picture on the website depicted on that site of the studio suite that we had booked as well as the king suite on that site unfortunately the room was on the second floor directly overlooking the street and extremely noisy because we knew that we were being jerked around and that this room was not an quotupgradequot but the original room that we were promised we protested by now we had lost any chance we had of making our reservation at the gramercy park for dinner and we were still dealing with our room situation my husband went down to discuss the situation with the manager quotcostasquot and came up fuming with the comment that he should have known he was going to be hustled by a greek my husband is himself greek in fact we were married in santorini greece extremely disappointing start to our nyc trip and we did in fact miss our dinner reservation at gramercy which could not be rescheduled due to how busy they were that night basically my husbands birthday celebration with friends was ruined thanks to quotcostasquot at the six columbusthe next day thankfully we moved to the smyth tribeca now this is a hotel that knows about service we were treated with courtesy and respect and the hotel was great too bad that one of our four nights in nyc was ruined,Positive
we booked a queen superior room for nights and were upgraded to a queen deluxe at check in the room was a good size for new york and to a good standard staff were excellant and very friendly we really couldnt fault anything about the hotel during our stay the hotel is right at the edge of central park and in a very good location for visiting the rest of manhatten prices seemed to change quite a bit before we booked and we got an excellant rate on the hotel website the hotel is very close to whole foods in the time warner building which was brilliant for a wide range of good food would definitely stay there again,Positive
we stayed in this hotel nights as part of our honeymoon and we had one of our best times in nyc usually nyc hotels offer either small and old rooms or big and old rooms this case was totally new and refreshing the columbus is a small boutique hotel in the middle of manhattan offering modern and comfortable rooms combined with friendlly and professional staff the first thing we liked about the hotel is that as honeymooners they upgraded our room to a studio suite we got a room on the th floor it was a spacious room with a big bathroom full of quotgoodiesquot i must say that the bed is one of the best ive ever slept on the area is excellent the nearest subway is across the street the park is two minutes away and you have lots of shops and places to eat in the vecinity for all the sushi lovers i recommend the blue ribbon restaurant on the hotel excellent sushi friendlly and nonpretentiousresuming if you are looking for a nice boutique hotel in midtown manhattan this is definately your place the prices are attractive and the return is more than enough we are definatelly looking forward to visiting this hotel againthe only negative thing i can think about is that the internet was not free,Positive
we recently stayed at columbus for two nights as part of a three week nyc stay where we changed hotels a few times to experience different neighbourhoods our first impression was that the front desk were not too friendly however the doormen were extremely friendly on check in we were given a room on the nd floor i think and it was pretty much what you see on the internet pictures nice retro style but small room if that was a queen bed then im the queen of england it was barely a double i think bathroom was nice with good keihls ammenitieshowever we didnt stay in this room long we had a shower straight away as wed just come in from dc on the train and immediately realised the noise of the air con unit outside was absolutely insane it was a constant hum and every five mins it would kick into gear and go up to a dull roar we both said we cant stay in this room so went down and asked to be swapped they had a room on the th floor available which was nowhere near as noisy so we took that one even though it had a slightly strange smell about iti think perhaps a weird air freshener room i think was a bit bigger as well and also had a window you could look out not a frosted glass window where i felt a bit claustrophobic like in the nd floor roomstaff were helpful we asked one of the doormen for a dinner reccommendation and it was good didnt eat at the hotel restaurant so cant comment on thatloved the location right opposite the time warner building with whole foods in the basement which we patronised for breakfast lunch and snacks the subway is also right there too which is handy we walked to th ave where there are many great restaurants and it was only about mins walk which was great would definitely stay here again and make sure i get a high floor room we had a queen deluxe i think and we got what i thought was a great rate on quikbook note take the elevator up to the roof deck and take some photos from up there we got some great shots if they ever get the bar open up there it will be an excellent spot,Positive
we were staying for four nights and booked on quikbooks it worked out at nights for the price of average of per night we stayed in a studio suite on the th floor friends of ours stayed on the th floor in a studio suitethe suite was very spacious with lots bathroom had a great walkin shower with great water pressure and also a bath which i personally love an oddity about the bathroom is clear glass in the window room had a wooden floor which i liked and the bed was large and comfortable and there was lots of storage space on the downside air conditioning was noisy at times and sound travelled from other rooms the suite on the th floor was more compact didnt have the walkin shower but had a fantastic balcony space although a chair or two would have been nice given the hot weather this was a great place to relax especially in the eveningthe bar and restaurant wasnt to my taste as im not into japanese food but it was busy most nights and the food looked like a work of art the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful to us at all times although they seemed a little clueless with how to deal with a guest that had her handbag stolen from the starbucks next door there was no advice on hand and the distraught guest had to try to think of all the things that had to be done herself from ringing the consultate to cancelling the credit cards to informing the policeinternet at per day is expensive especially since it was wireless and there is no free access in the lobbyoverall we loved it and wed certainly stay there again,Positive
i was vising a friend on the ues amp didnt want to pay outrageous room rates the location is perfect as its behind the time warner bldg on the lower left hand corner of central parkgood theres a subway station across the street amp plenty of taxis i opted for the quotpod roomquot as i was only there for night and didnt care much about view the room was smaller then rooms ive had in paristhough it was very nice the shower was impressive as most hotels dont have that much water pressurebad the quotpod roomquot is that its view is of a inaccessible courtyardwhich has a large hvac pipe running up the center of it during the night you hear banshee like howls as this kicks onoff if your intolerant of quotwhite noisequot you wont like the loud blowing of the ac into your roomi quite liked it the ipod alarm clock has a backlit lcd which is very bright other then unplugging it i couldnt figure out how to turn it off,Positive
yes the rooms are small but really is that much different than most other rooms in nyc the pros of this hotel are great location to cp subway cnn mall wholefoods starbucks great price from website but what really makes this place great is the staff every staff ive encountered this was now my second time here goes out of there way to be friendly helpful and to remember you by name and preferences ill be back again on my next biz trip to nyc,Positive
booked a queen room through quikbooks i was grateful to check in early since i had just flown in on the red eye staff were cordial and helpful room was a good size and stylish bed was comfy found a couple of short hairs pinned to the undersheet of the comforter im pretty sure the sheets were clean for the most part since the staff inspected the room before they allowed me to check in rarely heard any noise from other guests except when they shut their doors to lock the door theres really no way to shut it softly housekeeping sometimes chatted loudly in the hallway and they start knocking loudly on doors around am to clean the rooms bathroom was large bathtub drained slowly had to turn off the water to let the water drain before turning it back on the tub finally clogged up on the last day of my stay at checkout hotel tried to charge me for the minibar even though i didnt use it i thought it was a fridge for my personal use i explained this and they promptly removed the charge despite the negatives i did enjoy my stay i feel i got a good deal on the room ive stayed at the hotel east houston which was advertised at a similar price but not nearly as nice the hotel is conveniently across the street from metro station and shopping nearby coffee shops were okay preferred whole foods across the street for better prices and better tasting food than places nearby bouchon bakery in the same complex as whole foods makes very good macarroons,Positive
the things that i liked about columbus include the great location and the great online deal that i got from the hotels website i especially loved the discovery of wholefoods right across the road in columbus circle shops best place for breakfast and snacksi love the atmosphere of the hotel very hip and trendy but i really dont understand why this seems to mean that everything has be kept in semi darkness putting on make up in a dimly lit bathroom is a nightmare and the bedroom itself is little betterthings that i didnt like other than groping in the dark are that the room is seriously small with no room for big bags for travellers in the middle of a big trip and the in room internet is very expensivethere was also an inidentified loud hum that went on all night possibly a heater or aircon unit outside either way it had us shopping for earplugs,Positive
this hotel was great for a number of reasons one of the first things we noticed was the friendliness of the staff everyone was so helpful because we arrived early in the morning our room was not ready however they called us on our cell phone as soon as it was available they were very helpful with restaurant suggestions great staff perfect locationright by central park subway across the street starbucks and dunkin donuts just around the corner hour pharmacy at the corner great breakfast spot just up the street shower was great and room was small but clean we didnt spend a lot of time there anyway so it didnt matter only complaint was that they didnt offer shower caps in the bathroom price was very reasonable compared to other ny hotels,Positive
we stay nights in the pod room with a double bed and we found it very roomy with a nice large bathroom this room is much larger than the regular one at hudson hotel where persons can barely walk around the bed or fit in the bathroom i like the room design very much the double bed is very adequate for medium build persons kiehls amenities are a plus and the heated bathroom floor is a nice touch the bed is almost as comfortable as the heavenly bed from the westin hotels with buildin drawer in the bed frame for additional storage space the location of this hotel is perfect for us as we came here for the opera at the met at the lincoln center less than minutes walk and the central park is just across in front of the hotel is the time warner center which blocks all the traffic noise the columbus circle subway is in the time warner center where all the major line connected we have breakfast at the organic whole foods market in the time warner center where they sell food by weight so you only pay what you want to eat you can have excellent meal here hotcold when you are in rush before the opera the starbuck is next door to the hotel for caffeine addicted the staff is super nice it is a super deal at in new york city on the down side the curtain cannot be close tightly the room door needs a stopper to avoid the banging when it is close especially at night and the walls are a little thin but this should not stop you from reserve at this hotel if you hate morning light binder clips should solve your problem,Positive
small rooms were dimly lit super thin walls i could hear every noiseshowermusicconversation that were taking place in the adjacent rooms there was a party taking place on my floor that wasnt moved till early in the morning so basically i didnt get any sleep and it totally ruined the next day for me the only pluses were that the rooms were clean staff is nice i got a cheap rate using quikbook and the location,Positive
an otherwise acceptable stay nights degraded by a room allegedly the largest and clearly the highest price offered short of a suite in which we couldnt sit down except on the bed even to work at the desk one chair was offered in a dimly lit vestibule otherwise there was literally no room to move closet space was a freestanding wardrobe with barely a foot of hanging space storage space was a drawer under the bed plumbing noises from adjacent rooms were noticeable and from time to time especially during neighbors showers loud i accept that space is at a premium in new york but this is absurd on the plus side such as it was its convenient to lincoln center pleasant and helpful staff and a good restaurant blue ribbon with excellent sushi if you plan to spend any time in your room look elsewhere,Positive
my wife and i stayed at columbus during a random weekend in new york this february we found columbus through tripadvisor and were encouraged by its ranking as of this writing in short we were not disappointed with our choice as it turned out to be anf extraordinary value for a nyc hotelfirst off a caveat about the location for this hotel for people not familiar with nyc its located right off columbus circle a good minute walk from times square this wasnt a deal breaker by any means however and the columbus circle subway stop is right near the hotel anyway a taxi ride right into the heart of times square was a measly as wellupon arrival the doors were opened for us and we were greeted with a smile and a polite welcome by everyone in the moderndecor lobby a great way to start a stay check in was a nonissue and we quickly found ourselves in one of the animal hide fakelined elevators going to our room on the th floor there are floors of rooms with two floors above thatwe opened the door to our queen deluxe room and found a warmly lit intimately sized room with a modern twist dark teak floors are throughout the the main room and you have amenities such as a flatscreen lcd tv minifridge safe bathrobe ironironing board ipod alarm clock and one of the most comfortable hotel beds weve ever slept on the brown teak headboard for the bed spanned the entire length of the wall behind us but stopped short from the ceiling by about inches this space hid a recessed light that lent a nice indirect glow to the room when onthe bathroom seems light standard fare but is very clean and boasts an interesting extra feature heated floors what a treat to not step onto a cold tile floor after a nice hot showerafter settling into our room we made our way downstairs where we found eric the concierge he was perhaps one of the most helpful and knowledgeable concierges weve ever had the pleasure of meeting he helped us with everything from our dinner plans to making reservations for us at a comedy club he recommended definitely a great resource to have when in nyc even if you consider yourself knowledgeablewe had lunch at the hotels blue ribbon restaurant japanese and found it about average and maybe a tad overpriced quite contrary to the hotel mind you there was nothing wrong with the sushi we ordered but it wasnt anything to write home about and the service was impersonal but prompt i would say its convenient but you have better choices literally right across the street in the timewarner building one other note about the hotel bring your own computer as they do not have a business center overall columbus was an excellent value and i would highly recommend it as a great hotel outside of times square,Positive
where can you stay in new york where the staff knows you by name after the first day wonderful location near theatre shopping and park rooms very nice and staff the best in new york great value cant wait to visit again,Positive
we stayed at the hotel for two nights terrific location its just across the street from the subway amp theres a great international newstand around the corner for those who indulge in starbucks theres one right next to the hotel our room was really small the queensize bed felt more like a twin the room was clean but not smartly designed theres a great big flat screen tv but no hooks for your coat the bathroom floor was heated but theres virtually no closet space great shelves for magazines but very little drawer space talk about priorities all mixed upoverall our stay was pleasant amp the staff was pleasant the price was right too,Positive
we stayed at the columbus for nights at the end of jan we got a superb rate through quikbook which made this hotel very affordable i booked a queen superior as i had been informed that the pod rooms were very small if i was indeed given a queen room then those pod rooms must be a broom cupboard having said that the room was more than adequate for the of us as we did not intend to spend a lot of time in the room anyway the only downside to the size of the room was lack of storage for clothes and given that it was winter we had a lot of bulky clothes but we managedthe room was on the th floor at the back of the hotel with a nice view of the shaft but didnt think this mattered as i wasnt going to spend my time looking out of the windowthe under floor heating in the bathroom was indeed a nice touch as others have mentioned but couldnt quite work out how it worked the shower was great powerful amp hot the only downside of the bathroom was the miniscule towels no good for wrapping up wet hair the mini bar was packed full but didnt try anything as there is a duane reade next door service at the hotel was very good very attentative door staff and it was nice to receive a plate of cookies half way through our stay the bar staff where also very pleasant in the blue ribbon bar amp restaurant we did not eat there the cleaning staff where a little noisy in the mornings but really we should have been up and seeing the sights anywaythis hotel is in a great location right opposite the subway and over the way from central park a few nice bars amp restaurants nearby i would definitely recommend this hotel but only if you can get a great rate as otherwise i think it is quite pricey,Positive
i have to differ with most of the reviews ive read maybe its a generation thing yes the staff are fine very helpful and the place is clean but why is it that so many quot starquot hotels in nyc give you less than a holiday inn and charge you much more money no coffee in the room no free wifi no ironing boardiron three big marks against the place in my book and the nyctiny rooms not as bad as the hudson down the street but still no place to sit and relax read a book etc and the decor yikes dark blue hallways elevator walls covered in faux black fur with industrial metal accents i felt like i was entering a dungeon but its a fabulous location the bed was ok the soaps were nice and it was quiet but then again i booked with priceline so my window faced an brick wall not the street,Positive
my monday mlk holiday overnight accommodations at columbus far exceeded my expectations i was greeted by the doorman as i entered and again by the host of blue ribbon sushi amp grill the staff at the front desk were delightful especially adrianna my reservation for a pod room was gleefully upgraded to a suite room on the tenth floor the lobby is small but neatly furnished with a long modern sofa and bright round club chairs neat artists prints hung on the wall low lighting down the hallway of the elevators the elevators are modern i stepped into a blue hallway with thompson hotels signature carpet i felt like i was in a residential apartment building with my room number glowing bright my room key was tucked into a designer columbus packeti entered into an oversized modern thoughtfully designed room large platform bed frette linens and robe modern side chairs and table and flat screen television and black and white cabinet with mini bar dean amp deluca snack tray and available shag kitluxurious drapes hide french doors which lead to a giant balcony behind frosted doors were a large walk in closet and gorgeous bathroom another window looking towards th street was tucked in an angled corner beautifully shaded silver floor lampno carpet all hardwood floors and allergyfree including the teak headboard wall pockets containing glossy design and fashion magazines bendable reading lampsa blue throw white duvet striped pillow and drapes were all made of the finest quality luxury material the bathroom was a standout with navy vertical subway tiles under mounted sink private loo area free standing two person shower large deep soaking tub with its own shower high end bath toiletries from kiehls thoughtful extras like cotton balls and swabs fluffy white towels and a giant round magnifying mirror under lit in blue located in the lobby is blue ribbon sushi amp grill always open extra late and welcoming to my late arrival located directly across the street from columbus is the time warner center a luxury shopping venue close to subways columbus circle and central park made columbus a thompson hotel to be envied by all manhattan boutique hotelsyes i will stay there again thank you columbus,Positive
i booked the hotel through quickbook at a rate of for frisat and for sun there were no problems with the booking and i would throughly recommend quikbook as a third party agentupon checkin i was given a free upgrade from standard queen to supeior or deluxe not sure which it is the doormen make you feel very special and could not do more to help as others have said they are all pretty hot too i didnt really find the noise of the aircon too loud the view was of some nondescript building and some shafts but that didnt bother me the only minor negatives i can think of and im having to think hard were that the ipod docking station wasnt dusted down and the bed frame sticks out a little so i banged my leg a few times for the rate i got these are such small things that it really means nothing compared to the fantastic service and great clean rooms at the columbus location quality and genuine warmth and hospitality from the staff here makes this place exactly what it is a perfect little hotel for any traveller to new york city,Positive
my friend and i got an amazing rate at columbus through quikbook for january for frisat for sunday we had an excellent stay from the moment we walked through the doors and the very friendly doorman took our bags and welcomed us all the staff were kind and helpful providing excellent servicewithout asking our room was upgraded free of charge to a queen deluxe with two beds which was perfect the room was spotless and housekeeping brought us a second robe and nonfeather pillows for my friend who is allergic the bed platforms are a bit of a nuisance but not a big deal our biggest complaint was probably that the ice bucket while very stylish was quite shallow and not really functional clearly im really nitpicking hereive seen comments complaining about the loud heatingair system and it is indeed loud however if youre like me and my friend and you need white noise to sleep its perfect the beds are also very very comfortable and we both slept like babiesthe hotel location is perfect right by the subway a subway sandwich shop starbucks and a whole foods in the time warner center across the street easy walk to central park and the theatre district and when we were in a rush to make a show the cab down cost and took five minutes while i wouldnt want to spend a night at columbus or anywhere for that matter i definitely recommend the hotel we had a great stay and even received a hug from the doorman when we left it was a terrific weekend,Positive
lets start with the only quotnegativequot my room was small but everything needed was provided in a welldesigned and aesthetically pleasing space the bed linens and towels added to a feeling of luxury and stylethe staff was the real standout in an otherwise great experience every single individual working at the hotel took the time to greet me anyone that i addressed with a request question or simply a quothelloquot responded warmly and wholeheartedly their friendliness which was never anything but respectful created the sense of having a home base in nyc and really added to the pleasure of my trip,Positive
the best thing by far about columbus is the location you are within walking distance to both the theater district and lincoln center and you are close to many fine restaurants the columbus circle subway stop is literally right across the streetthe hotel itself is very modern and although the lighting and decor were not quite to my taste i must say that the staff was the friendliest ive encountered at a hotel in a long time the room while small was spotless our only complaint would be that the heater seemed to just blow cold air around the room so we ended up just turning it off and asking for another duvet actually even with the heat off the room wasnt really all that coldthe heated bathroom floor was a really neat featurewe got a great rate through the hotel website and wed definitely recommend this hotel to anyone whos planning on attending a show or concert and doesnt need a whole lot of space,Positive
we stayed in the columbus hotel for nights in march for st patricks weekend overall its a great hotel which i would recommend the hotel is located opposite the time warner building just at the bottom of central park we walked nearly everywhere it was in such a convenienct location the staff were very friendly and helpful check in was fine our room wasnt ready but we were offered complimentary drinks in the hotel bar while we waitedwe had booked a pod room however on checking in we were advised we had been upgraded to the next biggest room accommodation was lovely very modern with plasma tv ipod docking station and minibar we got a complimentary paper everyday and the room was cleaned daily also we didnt eat at all in the hotel but the restaurant always looked busy and the hotel has a nice little bar for those apres shopping drinksall in all i would recommend this hotel the rooms are quite small but hey this is new york city youre there to shop and to party not sit in your room all day special mention to all the gang next door in the coliseum pub hi guys,Positive
spent one night with family we had two rooms both were upgraded which gave us extra space and room to hang out together and fantastic value loved the style of the decor the staff was very friendly and helpful the sheets were terrific and rooms were quiet surprising to the two of us were are exmanhattanites etc our only complaint if we were to have one was that the sofabed in one of the rooms wasnt made up which we didnt discover until we needed it late which entailed a short wait improvised bedding and making it up ourselves true the quotturndownquot staff had been by at about but at that point we were using the sofa as a sofa if you want to be near the upper west side andor theatre district and are looking for a luxurious stylish place to stay youll be happy,Positive
i have nothing but great things to say about this hotel it is beautiful the staff are so friendly we arrived at this hotel at in the morning from an overseas flight we were not expecting to check in to our room until at least noon but we thought we would try anyways upon arrivalwe found that the room we had booked was not available but the receptionist offered to upgrade us to a junior suitestudio suite for an additional i was very glad we did this room was huge and gorgeous we had a square foot balcony no breathtaking view but what a surprise the concierge was more than willing to reccommend places for dinner and get our reservations for us for shows and dinner as well as call towncars etc a little tip goes a long way with these people we even recieved a quotwowquot from one of the guys after making a complete mess of our room before we went out to dinner the housekeeping staff came in and reorganized it all i was not expecting this as it was pm and was actually a little bit embarassed by the state of our room just one of the things that added to our amazing stay at this hoteli would definitely stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat,Positive
we just got back from an incredible trip to new york city and philadelphia we stayed night at columbus in nyc and it couldnt have been better the location is great if you dont want to be at times square and you dont want to go as far as the quotupper west sidequotthis hotel is located in the middle of them it is very close to the trump and mandarin hotels it is next door to a starbucks amp across from large grocery store whole foodsnow for the hotel itself check in took only seconds the hotel features a very cool decor with a great city vibe we went for the cheap seats and got a pod room which is a full size bed the room is tiny but it is flawlessly designed to maximize space do be careful not to hit your leg on the bed corners can be quite painful the bed was very comfortable and had crisp white bedding i must admit we are not a fan of down type pillows there was a stocked refreshment case but we did not use it the flat panel tv was quite nice the view from our window well we had a lovely view of nothing but we were not in nyc to look out our window now for the bathroomi have to say i now want rip out my own bath and copy the one from columbus the floor is heated dont underestimate how incredible this feature is nyc at thanksgiving is very cold and this floor feels fabulous on your frozen toes there is a very cool tiled shower no tub and great bath products they even thought to give you qtips and cotton ballsa lovely touch the bathroom sink is really beautiful too with a cool gooseneck style faucet the towels smell great too sound weird i know but the towels arent perfumey they just have a nice fresh smell to them very pleasantthe hotel staff was excellent and they had our luggage loaded in to a cab before we ever blinkedthey make everything look easy herei would highly recommend giving this hotel a try if you are ever planning to visit the macys parade then this location would be terrific you wont see it from your window but youll have total access in just stepswithout the chaos of times square,Positive
recently returned from a night stay at columbus very nice small chic hotel in a great location central to everything stayed in a king deluxe room with a very comfortable bed quotcoolquot decor with a nice flat screen tv on the wall the entire hotel including the rooms are dimly lit which gave it a hip night clublike atmosphere the customer service was outstanding from start to finish the doormen always welcomed you with a pleasant greeting front desk staff were very friendly and courteous and check in and check out was fast and smooth the front desk and doormenstaff communicate with wireless devices as soon as i got there by cab the doorman opened the taxi door and asked me my name and quickly alerted the front desk via the device that i had arrived and they were totally prepared for me by the time i reached them they even had the doormen have a cab waiting for me at the precise time i checked out and walked out the front door very well organized operation the only thing i didnt like was the shower the tile wasnt that clean and the shower head didnt work that well no tub in the room there was no iron in the room either overall i reccommend this hotel for young singles who are looking for a cool safe place to stay at reasonable rates,Positive
out of all the hotels we have stayed in this one had the very be st location wonderful staff quiet nice barjust great for people subway whole foodsgreat for carry out to hotel after a long day with a glass of winetime warner buidling with great shops and places to dine cvs a couple of doors down for those items you forgot to bring plus a starbucks or anotherless expensivecoffee shop zabars is up the street central park is across the streetjust a great quiet oasis in a busycity all hotels have a negative but this one has more s than smodern and clean you feel as though you are in nyc my friend and i are in our late s and we were very comfortable with this hotel could not beat the price,Positive
my wife and i had a layover in nyc and decided to spend the night the hotels was very clean and modern all the people at front desk where very polite friendly and helpful i love the room yes it is very small but very well done ive seen hotel try to cram too much into similar sized room but this is perfect i will definetly stay there again,Positive
awesome location for this modern boutique hotel right across the street from time warner center the staff members at this hotel were fantastic from the doormen to the front desk all seemed to work on the guests behalf almost effortlessly the room superior queen was fine for adults but a bit small the bathroom was modern and nice we were on the th floor and our view was of the hvac system not surprising for nycthe hotel was perfect for us i would certainly stay here again and would highly recommend to my friends i wouldnt recommend to someone expecting a large full service restaurants gym etc hotel,Positive
i usually stay at marriott or other chain hotels pricelined this one and wasnt sure what i was goin to get i booked the hotel thru priceline for night hoping to get an upgrade standard room is a full size bed sq ft room i called them up and they upgrade me for more to a king superior usually nitethe hotel has a great staff and quite accomodating the location is not on columbus circle but on th st you walk out the door and columbus circle is less than a minute walk across the street overall it is a nice place rooms little small but you pay for location,Positive
we have just returned from our stay at columbus and our experience was very different to that of some of the other guests we booked a queen room for a reduced rate via the quikbook website the quikbook site clearly stated that the room was for a maximum of people upon arrival it was clear that booking via quikbook meant that you were given the smallest rooms in the hotel there was no way that people could stay comfortably in this queen roomthere was only single wardrobe no natural light hardly any floor space around the bed and nowhere to store our large suitcases i spoke to lula on the front desk and she went out of her way to ensure that we were happy with our accommodation she showed me other rooms which were much more suitable for couples and managed to offer us a larger queen room at an extremely reasonable upgrade price throughout our stay lula made a point of checking that everything was ok with our room with regards to the rest of the hotel we really couldnt fault it all of the staff were extremely friendly particularly the doormen we didnt try the restaurant but we did drink at the bar a few times and they even served sushi to us at the bar my only gripe would be that the bar area is quite small with limited seating the room we actually stayed in was a great size the double wardrobe was more than adequate and there were large drawers under the bed also the ipod docking station was a nice touch as were the khiels toiletries in the bathroom and the free daily newspapers the room temperature control took some getting used to but overall it served its purpose and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was very welcme after a hard days sightseeing the bed was also very comfortablehousekeeping did a great job at keeping the room immaculate and also turned down the bed every night leaving little treats on the duvetin addition to the great service and comfortable room the hotel is in the most amazing location the time warner centre is literally across the road which houses a large whole foods market and lots of nice restaurants starbucks is next door and there were several places to get a great breakfast just up the street columbus circle was right on the doorstep including the best entrance to central park overall we really enjoyed our stay at columbus and we would definitely stay here again on our next visit to new york,Positive
we stay in nyc about times a year in the off season when we can find decent rates we have stayed in many boutique hotels including hotel giraffe the muse and the benjamin we booked the smaller king room at columbus and it was small but how much time do you stay in the room it was clean and the bathroom was clean and staff was great we ask for a quiet room and it was very quiet the hotel was great and you cant beat the location there is no roof top bar i read about that either on quickbook or their own site but when we went to locate it all we found was dirty laundry there is a huge whole foods across the street to peruse including lots of food to go we walked central park twice which is right across the street and we could walk to our broadway show we booked directly with the hotel and the same day found a considerable lower rate on quickbook i called the hotel and they matched the rate we will definitely stay here again,Positive
stayed at columbus for nights in late september and had a wonderful time im not terribly picky though and mostly look for a place thats safe and clean and columbus definitely delivers in both respectsi got a really great deal thru quikbook for a pod room full bed and since i was by myself that was perfect i will say however that if i had paid the hotels asking price of night i would have expected more but for night it was an outstanding valueyes the room is small but honestly if youre in ny for the room then you do need to go elsewhere the bed was incredibly comfortable linens clean and soft and housekeeping did a wonderful job every day the bathroom was wellappointed though the tub was a bit small if you actually wanted to take a bathwhich i refuse to do at hotels anyway heated floor tiles in the bathroom definitely a plus kiehls toiletries were a wonderful touch and there was also qtips and cotton balls in the bathroomsimple but very nice touch thing i did notice missing was a coffee potbut there is a starbucks next door to the hotel so it really didnt matter that much to me the view from room was terrible as most have described to some kind of shaft in between buildings but you know what i was never in my room during the day looking out the window and at night the blackout drapes were closed so why do i care what the view was so it all depends on you after my rave reviews my coworker stayed at columbus the very next weekend and loved it as much as i did oh and the umbrella they provide for you to use during your stay came in handy as it rained out of the days i was in ny will definitely return if the price is right,Positive
alright first the positives the location is excellent so close to central park the upper west side etc the hotel is clean and kept up nicely and staff members are fairly friendly but for night even if we are talking about manhattan one expects more than a mere square feet or so a socalled quotpod roomquot with a view of a pigeonoccupied tower of space about six feet by six feet a tiny bathroom admittedly with a heated floor a nice touch essentially upscale dormstyle furniture and lousy temperature controlall things considered experience suggests that one would do a lot better three times out of four by going on pricelinecom or the like and putting in night and stars again even for manhattan this didnt represent good value for money,Positive
funky little hotel in a great central location on manhattan island but our stay was ruined by a noisy air conditioner outside our window that the staff seemed either unable or unwilling to fix for the three nights we were therewould have been nice if theyd offered to move us to another room but no we even had to get the bellhop to run down the street and get ear plugs so we could sleepwould only stay here again if the room did not have an airconditioner outside the windowthere are better hotels in new york for the price,Positive
unfortunately we had to go to nyc last minute for a funeral the staff was incredibly caring especially lula we had four separate rooms which were all lovely the sheets are amazingly soft the decor is fabulouswatch out for the corners of the platform bedsplenty of closet and drawer space and the water pressure in the shower was fantastic as were the toiletries of the hotel starbucks is just next door so a latte is never far away whole foods is in a great mall across the street everything we needed was within walking distance including central park all in all its a bargain i would highly recommend columbus,Positive
this is definitely the place to stay if youre aim is to explore central park and hit the museums i got a really good deal for around us per night and its worth it clean modern great amenities and amazing sheets central park is right across road and all the bright lights of broadway times square and madison square garden are all within walking distance this truly is a gem located in midtown for the reasonable price you pay,Positive
we booked a queen deluxe room on quikbookcom for we were in room the room was bigger than i expected it would be the bed was perfect for with more than enough room,Positive
my mom and i stayed at this small boutique hotel right on columbus circle this hotel is small modern and had a wonderful hotel staff i had to upgrade to a bigger room and they were very accomodating the bathrooms and the room itself was clean it actually had this baby rose aroma smell that i just could not figure out what it was the beds were clean and soft i dont suggest large parties to stay here the rooms are not that large we came here to do some shopping and after days it was getting pretty crowded the location is pretty convenient there is a mini mall and subway right across the street in the cnn building pinkberry is right next door for some yummy yogurt and a block down is ave where there are tons of restaurants to choose from,Positive
i would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a simple yet quality stay at a hotel in ny for a reasonable price the decor is modern and pleasing the rooms are indeed small but well designed with hidden storage spaces like drawers under the bed the fresh bath products are a real plus as is the blue ribbon restaurant in the lobby the location across the street from the time warner building and the columbus circle subway station is also super convenient my only complaint and the reason why i didnt give this place higher marks was the full sized bed which was a bit cramped for two adults i booked the room through priceline at a great price and specified two people im not sure if its normal for the hotel to book two people to a room with a full sized bed but id recommend calling the hotel to make sure,Positive
after searching for a hotel with a good location in manhattan for a quotreasonablequot price i booked at columbus most prices i had seen were upwards of night and they had rooms at i have to say i left feeling really underwhelmed and disappointed for the money i spent positives location location location you really are paying here for location subway th streetcolumbus circle right across the street qnrw th ave less than blocks away less than block from time warner centercentral park cleanlinesshousekeeping service was outstanding drawbacksnegatives loud doors that seemed to slam frequently after pm many of the staff were nice but it seemed like many were trying so hard to be friendly and helpful that at times i wasnt sure anyone knew what exactly they were doing small rooms i upgraded to a queen deluxe having booked a superior and it was tinywith no view loud water pipes anytime anyone used the water to shower the pipes were super loud loud ac bloweri couldnt hear the tv when the ac blower was going and especially not when ac and water pipes were in use next door loud hum from pipesfans outside windowif you are not lucky enough to get a streetpark facing view and are stuck in the back you look out onto pipes from the adjoining buildingsunless their prices come down or i could get a quotdealquotless than per night i dont think i would stay here again,Positive
stayed at columbus aug after getting what was apparently an introductory rate on quikbook or so the location is great yes its not on columbus circle but barely block awaynot worth quibbling about with the subway and time warner center directly across the street and the park right across the circle the area is a lot less hectic than being further south but still convenientthe staff was extremely nice and unobtrusive the queen room was very spacious for nyc with a comfy bed desk flat panel tv and a huge bathroom it was nice to see a hotel think about the people who use their rooms and provide plugs on top of thethe interior rooms are a bit cavelike since you dont have a window but the lights have slider settings so you can make the room a lot brighter than the way the staff apparently sets it up in preparation for your visit im not sure why people fixate on the dark hallways i didnt run into anything and unlike other hotels with dark hallways the room numbers were lit upoverall i loved the hotels style comfort and location i dont know if i would pay full rate but in the range this is a good nyc hotel that would make your visit to the city very pleasant i would definitely stay again,Positive
i arranged my one night stay through quikbook at a rate of with this rate in mind i found the hotel very nice it was clean modern safe and nicely located in columbus circle the staff were friendly and fairly helpful for my few questions the only drawbacks i found during my stay were the loud doors and cleaning staff that seemed to be yelling quothousekeepingquot all morning long minor issuesas has been mentioned the rooms are small there are no views nor real amenities i would not pay the rates they list on their website for the queen room etc even in manhattan you can find a better room for that price i only needed a place to sleep near central park for one night and did little more than sleep in the room so it was perfect for my needs at the reduced rate nice new option in the city,Positive
my partner and i stayed at columbus circle not really on columbus circle over the memorial day holiday after making my reservation i called the hotel and talked to abbey to request high floor street facing which she confirmed when i spoke to abbey i even reserved an upgraded room since it was my anniversary upon check in we were given a small room on the nd floor even though i complained to the front desk i was told the hotel was full and nothing could be done for that night the clerk at the front desk advised us that we could move the next day to the room that was promised to us we were in the room until about am and no call from the front desk to change rooms when we arrived back to the hotel later in the afternoon still no call i finally called the front desk and they had the nerve to advise me that they were ready to move us but we had not called them generally hotels that run efficiently would contact the guest and coordinate these types of activities we finally moved to a room on the thth floor the room was oversized with a largeish bathroom facing the street there was one day when housekeeping had not cleaned the room by pm but this was quickly resolved without any hassle one note the beds that are used are platform so there is no box springs on the bed also this hotel does not use top sheets only a duvet im sure this works well in winter but not springsummer on the positive side the location is excellent and starbucks is next door each night the turn down service includes voss water chocolate a nice stay overall but with some problems and attitude from the front desk,Positive
i was in nyc for a business trip and stayed at columbus for nightslocationthe property is right across the street from the ace subway line and the shops at columbus circle it is a great location that is close just south of central park and an easy walk to everything midtown oh there is a starbucks next door too in case you need a caffeine fixstaffall the staff were wonderful to deal with they were friendly professional and helpful you would think this is one of the basicsroomill post some photos but the rooms are a reasonable size i wouldnt say that it was a large room as the king bed just barely fit with the side tables but it was serviceable no complaintsthe view was the back of another building i had the curtains drawn the whole time and thought it was fine if you want a brighter room and a good view ask for a suite in the front of the building the decor is slick but i agree with the other reviewers in saying that it is a bit too dark i like dark hip lounges but would like the bedroom a bit lighterneutralthe worst thing was the air conditioning system it worked but it was basically an onoff switch run by a thermostat this isnt bad in itself as the temperature was kept at a comfortable level but when on it was loud really loud i found it hard to do a video conference on my computer with the fan onsomething that ive never had issues with in other locations room amenitiesnicely furnished with frette robe dean and deluca snacks in the minibar and fresh bath products are a nice touchhotel amenitiesthe building is old and it shows its age you can either think of this as quirky and charming or dumpy i prefer the former it isnt a newly constructed hotel with a work out room pool etc not a big deal to me as i work out by walking everywhere while travelingthe hallways seem a bit darkas do the elevators that are covered in dark pony skin or something this is the hotels attempt to be hip and slick i can take it or leave it and would rather have brighter hallways and roomsthere is a pretty restaurant off the lobby that serves japanese inspired foods it is pretty vibrant at night it is ok not great and a bit expensive nice atmosphere but if you just want good food you can do better just by going on a short stroll around the blockoh wifilike all travelers these days i need wifiand the hotel is smart to have fully blanketed the building with free wifi a big plus whats with hotels that still want to charge for wifi access after already gouging for the stayoverallthis hotel has been greatly anticipated the retrofit is decent but nothing really to write home about a bit dark for my tastesi thought it was a nice hotel and would stay here again great location excellent staff decent room if you can get a good price it is a good play to stay,Positive
i stayed at this hotel on july and the hotel is located at th ave and th st across the circle from columbus circle and the time warner center i upgraded my room from a pod to a queen for an extra a night this made the rate more than i would have liked to pay as i had read posts where the rate was much better than i got but for new york it was a fair price the front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful and great to deal with the room was bigger than at the hudson down the block but not really big it was very well designed and pleasing to the eye if a bit dark the bathroom was shiny and very modern with the right amount of room the linens and towels were of an excellent quality and the bed was very comfortable everything was very clean i would definitely book here again if i can get a good rate as the location is ideal,Positive
we are in ny at least twice a year for business columbus was won on priceline for one night the second night we booked directly through the hotels websitewhile the hotels decor is a little too dark for our taste the staff was outstanding everyone was friendly professional and helpful we would definitely stay there again just because of the staff and locationwe upgraded our room to a king we were told it was worth the additional night the room was still on the smaller side pros outstanding staff nice hotel great area complimentary newspaper nighttime brownie at turndown also great sushi restaurant cons decor a bit dark bathroom door is glass so if you have light on at night it shows through door to room is heavy and it is difficult to close quietly,Positive
my wife and i spent four wonderful nights at this very trendy and elegant hotel for our honeymoon during the thanksgiving weekend of last year i had meant to write a review earlier but i never found the time shame on me this hotel was aesthetically beautiful since it had only been open for around a month when we stayed there the lobby is cozy and attractive the rooms are both homey and artsy in design although on the small side which is common for manhattan you really have to get used to the bed corners because you will end up banging your shins a couple of times against them but no matter the bathroom was comfortable and clean the tv set was an lcd screen which i liked a lot the hotel is perfectly located around the corner from columbus circle which makes it extremely easy to move within the city by subway bus or just by walking the staff was really friendly and attentive all in all we had a wonderful honeymoon and this hotel was a great part of it i tried to book us again to celebrate our anniversary this year but the rates have already gone up from what we originally paid i paid night i guess i was lucky that the hotel had just recently opened for those who can afford it i highly recommend it,Positive
stayed in this hotel for only one night and i wish i could have stayed longer for the same price of course we booked through priceline and got an amazing deal the hotel is a little bit hard to find the taxi driver could not find it and took us around and we ended up paying more fare but its in a great location central park is right across the street and times square can be reached by walking down broadway there is a shopping center right across the street but we did not have a chance to check it out we stayed in the pod room which is super tiny but extremely clean and decorated really well even though the bed is a bit small for two people it is really comfortable because of the pillow top mattress the flat screen tv was great but i would have liked to have maybe a little table or at least a chair to put things on i think there would have been enough room for a least a chair or a luggage holder i loved the bathroom it was very modern and pretty toiletries qtips and cotton balls there was a safe in the closet a bathrobe and an umbrella to use during your stay i was disappointed though because there was no hairdryer the ac in the room worked really well the staff was great i would recommend it to everyone and would definitely stay there again,Positive
i was pleasantly surprised by columbus having stayed a week at soho sister hotel sixty thomson last year i was pretty reluctant to repeat the experience but my sister and the attractive price point convinced me otherwise and im glad for thatthe location is super right on columbus circle near every convenience imaginable unfortunately most taxis had a hard time finding it for some reasoni booked the basic room and expected something tiny this being nyc but i was happy to find that although small it was spacious and had clever little storage spaces like underbed drawers the service is pleasantly unpretentious understated accomodating and most imptly inobtrusive loved the fresh toiletries could have more of a variety though too basicand although theres the jumpin and delicious blue ribbon sushi bar in the lobby it was never too noisy sceney or happening thankfullyi ate at the blue ribbon every day sometimes twice a day and once when i had some bad fish and became ill they waived my bill and gave me a voucher with min fuss cant blame them completely though travellers diarrhea may have played some part in thisthe room service breakfast though was overpriced and horrible burnt cold toast otherwise a sweet little spot im there next time im in manhattan,Positive
i got the most amazing deal on quikbook the bell staff reception and concierge are all extremely helpful not to mention very good looking this is a trendy hoteli also have to state that this place is spotless i have never stayed in a hotel more clean than this and it smells great too when they turn your bed down at night you even get a mini brownie to eat with your night capi stayed in a pod room dont be fooled by the name the room is a brilliant size you get a double bed more than enough floor space and a full size bathroom the only downside is that theres hardly any natural daylight even though you have a full size window it faces the shaftthe location is perfect just across the road from the time warner building and columbus circle subway and next door to a duane read also a stones throw from central parkif i can get another deal usually the hotel is quite expensive this will absolutely be my hotel of choice every time i go to new york i pity the poor suckers paying way over the odds for a tiny room at the hudson on the same road columbus is miles better,Positive
we got a great deal on this hotel through quickbook night for a king room the staff was very nice and helpful the room was clean and the bed comfortable the room was very small but for new york it was fine the location was great as well right across from columbus circle there is a whole foods so you can get anything you might need the subway is there too some things to be aware ofroom was tiny and although there was a desk and chair it would be very awkward to actually have to work at the deskthere was no hair dryer or ironing board im assuming i couldve gotten these from housekeeping had i needed themthe air conditioning is extremely loud i got used to it but if noises bother you it might be a problem we would definitely stay here again if we could get a similar rate i dont think i would pay though,Positive
just returned from nights at columbus a few highs and lows but overall very pleased the staff from front desk to housekeeing couldnt have been nicer or more helpful the young men at the front door that help with luggage and cabs etc were a delight they were bright polite friendly well groomed and well trained rooms are small but well designed beds are very comfy a small desk and chair in the rooms would make a great difference lighting in the rooms and bathrooms is very inadequate mood lighting just doesnt cut it when youre in the shower or shaving cant see instructions for use of the room safe on floor of closet because of lack of light overall i liked it and would go back kudos to staff and people who picked and trained them,Positive
i stayed at columbus for nights in may the hotel is fine for the price i paid but there are better hotels for similar prices the hudson for example rooms are tiny as expected location is great at columbus circle and near the park the room was pretty clean except for a strange goo on the bedside table and the front desk service was acceptableif you can get a good deal for a queen room i would recommend it if you dont need top notch service if paying regular price look elsewhere,Positive
i booked through quickbookcomsame day and got a wonderful rate for a queen room my husband and i had a wonderful time at this hotel pleasantly surprised the location is wonderfulclose to central park and times square the staff was so helpful now about the roomvery modern and nicely appointed i slept like a baby in the bed for nycwonderful dealespecially for a holiday weekend,Positive
i stayed here this past friday night and was thoroughly impressed for this price point columbus is a great hip choice it has a kickass location just behind columbus circle which makes it very convenient there arent a lot of largehotel amenities such as pool or business centre but its high on design bluesilverbrown trendy decor and nice boutiquey touches such as fresh brand toiletries the staff is friendly and the hotel small enough that you can get in and get out without long waits for anything its not for everyone but if you like hip boutique hotels you should definitely stay at columbus nowbefore all the rooms get trashed by overuse,Positive
ive just returned from three nights at columbus having stayed at new yorks hudson hotel a few years ago i knew what to expect at this property which seems to be similarly marketed to the young urban and hip set not sure if thats me but i had a queen superior room it was nicely appointed contained fresh bath products in the bathroom a heated bathroom tile floor that was most pleasant a flat screen television hung on the wall and a wellstocked minibar with top shelf alcohol and dean and deluca snacks the room is not the largest room ive ever stayed in but by new york standards it was more than adequate the bed fit in the room just fine and when im in ny i dont come to hang out in my hotel roomthat said my room could easily accommodate two people which seems to be a point of issue for some reviewers here there are two drawers for storage under the platform bed and a wardrobe for hanging clothes nice touches include an umbrella should it rain it did while i was there so that came in handy turndown service with a little mini brownie and excellent and adjustable task lighting bedside and on the deskthere is a restaurant just off the small lobby blue ribbon that has sushi its okay some would say great i would not that somehow manages to also do room service and traditional american breakfast for the hotel there are restaurants in the neighborhood a pub next door and a duane reade pharmacyconvenience store on the corneri had difficulty adjusting the heating and cooling system in the room it could be my own ineptitude i dont know the controls were those manual quotpoint the dial at the numberquot controls i am of the digital age press an arrow up to a number or down to a number anyway the climate in the room was perfect the first night then it rained which as you can imagine changed the humidity and outdoor ambient temps and all bets were off after that i didnt call anyone to complain and i still slept just finethere is also a very small lobby which particularly on the weekends i imagine thats when i was there uses music to assist in creating a hip and happening scene the music can be loud in the elevator and in the lobby but you wont hear it in your room i guess that covers it oh they seem to spray or pump in a signature scent similar to what other hotels are doing these days i find it pleasant slightly tropical with hibiscus notes perhaps either that or they have some nice smelling cleaning products while not offensive or in any way excessive if you are sensitive to smells be warnedthe hotel is located across the street w th from the time warner building at columbus circle great location overall i would recommend this property and look forward to returning soon probably next monthhappy travels,Positive
i booked this hotel based on its location price and traveler reviews on ta and elsewhere we stay in the city somewhat often so we know space is at a premium and affordable rooms are hard to findespecially in good locations i have to say you cannot beat the location of columbus easy to find it is just behind the time warner building with top notch shopping and dining just across the street the subway station is also just across the street making travelling throughout the city a snap if youd rather take a taxi the doormen will happily hail one for you in a matter of seconds central park is just steps away and on a good day you can stop by whole foods in the time warner center and pick up fixins for a picnic in the parkjoyous yes the rooms are small we had a pod room and really it took me back to my college dorm days that being said everything in it looked new and clean the bed was super comfy and the heated bathroom floors were great the fridge was wellstocked and the cabinet was filled with gourmet goodies there was a small closetand really how much closet space does one need on a trip i never hang all my clothes when i go awayit was ample for us there were down sides that i can think of the lighting in both the bathroom and room were horrible for putting makeup on and the room was hot when we arrived so we opened the window but just beware of all the pigeon poop i will say that in the days previous it had been quite chillythe service was awesome i really noticed how pleasant everyone was when we arrived our room was just being cleaned so they happily stored our baggage until our room was readyjust a short minutes later when we called for an iron and ironing board one arrived within minutes the front desk always greeted us by name and were fast and courteousi got a great deal on priceline so that was just icing on the cake this hotel was way better than many of the others we have stayed at for double the price i would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone,Positive
my boyfriend and i stayed at columbus for four nights at the beginning of april and had a fantastic stay now im considering it for a trip in the fall with my sisters when we got to the hotel we were greeted at the taxi cabs door by the very friendly doormen i have to commend the hotel on the doormen they have working for themwhat fantastic and friendly personalities they all have our room wasnt ready upon arrival so the manager gave us complementary drinks at the blue ribbon sushi bar a great little bar to frequent before dinner or when you come back from a long day of shopping get the grapefruit cocktail listed on the menu this simple gesture was a great indication of the stay we were going to haveonce we got up to our room on the th floor we were surprised at how cozy and lovely it was the room was small i believe we booked a queen superior but that is normal in new york and neither of us were bothered by it there were cute little touches all about the room magazine racks with uptodate publications in them like time out new york a vase with a real flower on the nightstand an ipod dock underthebed storage the bed was lovely and very comfortable every night we slept very well the bathroom was a good size with a deep tub so no showers overflowed onto the floor there was a windowshelf in the shower to place your toiletries the toiletries by fresh that the hotel supplied were fantastic the towels we so fluffy oh and the best part of the bathroom the heated floor in front of the shower area it was fantastic in the morning to step onto a heated floor and i even found myself standing on it after our long days of walkingmy only quotissuequot with the room is that after we both showered the room itself got rather humid and muggy the location of the hotel was fantastic there was a subway stop right across the street where we could get downtown very quickly one of the nicest things was being able to get up grab a coffee at bouchon bakery across the street and take a morning walk in central park i had reservations about staying uptown but ended up being very pleased with our location because i liked having the access to the park the upper east side and being able to get downtown to soho so quickly and easilyas i said up above i am already considering columbus for a trip in the fall and would recommend it highly from the staff to the comfy towels and bed to the fantastic location i could not have picked a better place to stay,Positive
absolutely loved this place will definately stay there again service was excellent linen towels bath robflat screen tv just like at home staff are very friendly and very cooperative had a blast,Positive
we just got back from a long weekend in new york and a wonderful stay at columbus firest let me say that the concierge rocks raquel and eric were amazing at setting up a series of events for my partners birthday celebration everything was perfection the room at columbus was very large for new york we booked a studio suite which had a balcony almost as big as the room everything about columbus is very cool the room lightinglinens furniture and bathroom are all top notch blue ribbon sushi was fatastic too i would highly recommend this boutique hotel for anyone who likes a little quotedgy swankquot in the hotels,Positive
we spent nights at this fantastic hotel originally booked a deluxe king at an excellent rate on perfect escapes but found a great deal for a suite on tablet hotels web page although we stayed in a studio king on our first night long story but handled very well by the hotel amp we loved that room too it was huge with a balcony amp enormous bathroom amp good view of a corner of central park but we decided to move to the suite we were given the choice amp it was a hard choice actually but the rooms of the suite were very quiet beautifully appointed with clever design features amp gave us plenty of space for a long stay amp overlooked th st amp the time warner center with a glimpse of central park as well amp exactly as portrayed on the hotels web site nadia kept it in great shape for us during our stay amp it was lovely to see her smiling face every daythe delightful julian welcomed us on arrival after our long flight from australia charming caeser showed us to our room amp greeted us by name every time we saw him again as did everyone at this gem of a hotel including ciaron amp stan who run a fabulous bar amp helped make our stay so fantastic along with richard amp all the staff at the marvellous blue ribbon sushi restaurant where we ate several times terrific menu sublime food amp decor amp most reasonably pricedgetting around nyc was as easy as great subway across the road literally seconds away but anytime we needed a taxi anthony amp parry were always on hand amp must be two of the most affable doormen in townaside from the others working at this hotelroom service swift amp not at all expensive for a hotel of this stature amp location and neither was the well stocked mini bar free internet amp breakfast downstairs in the morningswhich we never got to eat too many laughs at night in the bar this was my th time in nyc have stayed in a variety of hotel types but wanted to try somewhere new doubt that i would ever stay anywhere else again unless rates go through the roof which they might well do then again i would probably pay them as we had such a magnificent timean easy walk to theaters whole foods across the street for a quick bite chemist amp starbucks next door amp anything else you might need close bywe are kinda fussy travellers but appreciate service par excellence amp a hotel that turns out to be what it portrays to be no wonder we cant help but be blown away by this wonderful stay at columbus spend the extra for a suite studio or deluxe room amp have a ball we feel indebted to everyone associated with this hotel amp wish them continuing success,Positive
we chose to stay in six columbus because of the great location and reviews found here at tripadvisor i would recc this hotel to those looking to explore the city and indulge themselves at a boutique hotelthe hotel was very clean and the staff was quite helpful and courteous the location is top notch directly across from the shops at columbus circle which houses a whole foods which is perfect for a tasty and inexpensive breakfast next door to the hotel is starbucks a bit further you will find a duane reade and dunkin donuts you will find central park minutes away and times square is a quick minute walk from the hotel many subways are literally found right outside the front door of the hotelwe had a weak wireless internet signal that was not protected minimal noise from inside or outside the hotel newspaper each morning and the best minibar and snacks ive ever seen our room was a good size queen superior and loads of space for all of our luggagethe few downsides we noticed werethe heater did not heat up the room i wanted and it would only reach i had to sleep with a hoodie on for two nights to keep warm we notified the front desk twice and upon check out we were told it was a problem within the entire hotel and they were working on itvery strange that the cleaning staff never left the right amount of towels not even when we checked in first day no hand towels then no face towels then again no hand towels very strange but housekeeping quickly bought up the towels when requestedlastly we could not get a seat in the bar or dining area on the two nights we tried yes we could have called ahead but as a guest at any other hotel ive stayed in this has never been a cause for concerneven with the few downsides id stay here again,Positive
found this hotel mostly by reviews on this website and others and due to the fact that it had a really nice daily rate compared to other trendy hotels in nyc i have lived in nyc but not visited much and usually stayed with friends and family when i did and therefore have very little to compare this to with regards to other manhattan hotels overall my wife and i really liked the hotel the room was very nice clean and with a comfortable bed and a nice tv it was also very small with a view of an airshaft and a tub made for a hobbit having lived in a small place in manhattan myself this did not bother me much but i can see someone not used to such cosy quarters having trouble with it only other problems were that they kept having laundry delivery problems resulting in not having washcloths for two days also give you the post the post and the wall street journal is in the lobby are they also in the rupert murdoch empire to be fair they did offer to send someone out to get me the times but it wasnt worth having to tip the same price as the paper the location is great with easy access to acbd trains central park midtown and uws and the village i was really impressed with the bar at blue ribbon sushi bartenders were awesome and the food was good unfortunately the sushi was inferior to the fried chicken which was great go for the alcohol overall it was a nice week and a nice hotel would definitely stay there again if for no other reason than it is a nice place in a good location,Positive
we stayed at the hotel because we had reservations for dinner at per se the location cant be beat it was across the street from the time warner center the employees were very courteous there is a duane reade or rite aide or similar drugstore right next door in case you need something the hotel doesnt provide when we checked in they said they were upgrading us to a king deluxe but the bed was not a king not a problem since the room was not too small we were too exhausted to complain bathroom is decent with heated floors but only half the floor was heated by the sink but not in front of toilet or showerbath fresh bath products turndown service at night inner rooms look out onto rooftop or shaft area loud ac unit from nearby buildings may keep you up at night if you are a light sleeper subway stop across the street whole food market in the tw center has a great food court for a snack to go right next to central park,Positive
my wife and i stayed at columbus for a sat night in march the hotel looks like its brand new its a smaller building on th and th ave but right off of the famous columbus circle and on the corner of central park so the location is quite central to midtown and upper west side the stylings are quite modern and the staff were very attentive we were upgraded from a pod room to a queen size bed for free which was great that said the hotel is a very small building and the rooms are a little smaller than average but two people dont really need more space than that what matters is that the hotel is clean and brand spanking new i would definitely recommend this hotel to couples with no children but probably only at the right price ive heard the hotel rates average around and up but i got a greal deal on perfectescapescom for for a pod room these may not last long as the hotel gains more and more popularity,Positive
i have stayed at the columbus months ago and decided to book again this hotel because i had liked my experience there i also booked this time through quikbook which is the way to get the best rates i had given it a star last time because i had trouble sleeping of the nights there were rowdy boys next door and even if i called the front desk the manager could not get them to quiet down this time was totally different i did not hear anything even if i was near the elevator there are not many rooms per floor so there is less chance of people walking by your room i booked the queen room this time because there were no pod rooms available but when you are alone one or the other will do just finethe staff is simply the best i arrived at in the morning and was given a room right away almost all the doormen recognized me and welcomed me back warmly they treat everyone the same and that is the biggest compliment i can pay them they dont cater to only the trendy clientele they cater to everyoneeven if you are not a something modelthe staff in the restaurant is the same the manager quint and the barmen especially keith treat you warmly and i was even offered a nightcap when i stopped by in the evening before heading to my room it is a great plus for the hotel because you feel like lingering there even if you are on your own they take great care of you i would love finding something to complain about because then i could write to the manager and hope for complimentary nights in return but i cant find anything negative to say about this hotel i just fear that i will not be able to afford it much longer when their prices will surely go upd,Positive
if you a regular vistor to nyc youll know that hotels are very expensive and you probably use craigslist to sublet well thats what i normally do but i found a really good rate on the hotels website dollars for the standard room per night now it is small but where it lacks size it makes up for other things the location is perfect i walked everywhere even in the snow its right by the subway and if you take the train to the airport thats just dollars and minutes on the express trainits right next to my favourite store wholefoods so i was in their everyday and then right by the park and near all the shops on fifth avenue the staff are very young and trendy but very helpful the room was very nice clean and excellent minibar there was a complimentary copy of the new york times everyday and thats the only way to get news outside the states unless of course you watch cnnthe bathroom was cool heated floors and fresh brand cosmetics watch the shower very hot but lovely then you can wrap up warm in the cosy bathrobeall in all for bucks a night it was great i would definitely go again but if i stayed longer or with someone else i would go for a bigger roomoh yes the bed was lovely too,Positive
did a last minute trip to nyc with my girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised we stayed in a quotpodquot room which was quite small but very clean and well appointed the bathroom was a normal size the entire hotel has been redone is very chic the hotel bar is small but cool and you are right across the street from the time warner mallbuildingand right by the park we got a great rate of night from wwwquikbookcom and couldnt pass it up i would highly recommend this property if you require space do not stay in the pod room we didnt plan on staying in our room very much so it met our needs,Positive
i was very pleased with my one night stay at columbus they had a minor computer glitch which caused a brief delay in my checkin no more than minutes and they upgraded me to a quotdeluxequot room to make up for that the staff were very friendly and made a point to address me and other guests by name even the bellmen the room was small but very comfortable and the bathroom amenities by fresh were a nice touch at the rate i got on com it was a good deal and i would definitely stay there again,Positive
had a great stay at columbus in january i found the staff to be very nice and attentive the decor is fabulous in the lobbyits got a very young hip vibe also had great food in the restaurantblue ribbon the rooms are small w no view at least for us but thats what i expect in new yorkbut all of the elements in the room were nicegreat linens a flat screen tv fresh products in the bathroom my only complaint might be that we were close to the elevator and i heard it in the morningoverall great experience so nice that im sure i wont be able to afford it when the hotel is completely finished,Positive
surprised by excellence of this hotel welcoming staff nice atmosphere good music everywhere lovely design and heavenly beds weve booked the hotel directly and did get a good deal for a hotel of this category location was good because of many metroconnections nice area with many locations for breakfast pain quotidien etc we were very happy to have been staying in this upmarket area instead of times square and other midtown locations,Positive
first off tripadvisor needs to immediately correct this hotels onestar rating as well as its average quot per nightquot rate both are skewed on criteria to which i am not awarei am a former native new yorker and ive stayed both before and following my move in a variety of the citys best hotels as well as a few of its worst including this one in its previous incarnation where i had the displeasure of seeing mice periodically pop their heads through holes in the pink shag carpet i only wish i was kidding thankfully shag and mice have long since dispersedi received a rate of night for a queen room not one of the nowinfamous quotpodsquot via booking directly through their own web site even considering the nosedive nyc hotel rates take in january and february thats a total steal that said my room was nonetheless very small and i banged my shins on that infernal platform bed on multiple occasions i also had some issues with my acheat system which is the only reason im not giving this place five starsthe location next to the columbus circle subway stop makes it a perfect juncture for reaching most areas of the city via subway and although its too cold to appreciate it this time of year im sure its location practically next door to central park will prove a major bonus as wellblue ribbon for those of you unfamiliar with the city is one of its best quotminichainsquot with only total and the columbus location is its first uptown i ate there and was highly highly impressed its some of the best sushi in a city filled with formidable sushi restaurants including the infamous masa across the streetsadly it looks like management is already onto the fact that they priced the rooms too low their winter rates are already up to night for this upcoming weekend on their site not quikbook,Positive
we visited nyc from the uk for a night stay at the end of novemberbeginning of december and the hotel was excellent put simplythe staff are really friendly and helpful down to earth friendly not kissing friendly they all were polite and we enjoyed chatting to them as we left in the morning and returned later in the day concierge was really helpful right down to booking a table at a sushi restaurant for us a few blocks over when we realised the one downstairs was closed on mondayswe had a pod room which did face the building at the back but ultimately its that or the busy street at the front of the hotel i know which one id prefer and did it was adequate size wise as was the bathroom heated floor and powerful shower were just the job after being out all day the bed was massive and possibly the most comfy weve slept in flat screen tv was just the ticket as was the ipod stereo on the bedside tablelocation wise the hotel cant be faulted we ended up walking most places as nothing was more than a min walk away really time square was about mins max if you didnt have to keep stopping to cross the roads and if that sounds alot believe me there is more than enough to keep you entertained walking around yellow cabs could be got right outside on those occasions we didnt fancy the walk on our final day we got a yellow cab down to the staten island ferry port for about then spent the afternoon walking up to the hotel stopping for coffee and shopping along the way if you walked it with no stops youd be looking at hours or sosushi restaurant and bar are super cool as the hotel in general really pastries and coffee in the morning in the bar watching the world go by is a good way to start the morning and tasty sushi in the evening in relaxed surroundings a good way to end itthe one negative was that the room we had was at the end of a corridor with two other rooms some nights we got a bit of noise lift door quotdingquot or a door slam this was reduced by closing the door that allowed access to the three rooms so all in all not a big issuewe used a generic hotel booking website so got a decent deal id happily recommend this hotel and make a return visit in the future when we go to london we stay at a hotel called the hoxton and this hotel is very similar in style atmosphere and comfortall round excellent,Positive
thoroughly enjoyed my stay at columbus the hotel is situated midtown opposite the time warner centre and within walking distance of times square central park and all the important shopping streets the hotel is small and intimate the staff are very attentive and the concierge is very helpful he arranged a fab night out for us and put us on all the guest lists i was expecting a pokey room given the reviews but the pod room really wasnt that small the room comes with a very comfy bed designer edibles ipod docking station flat screen and the bathroom even has heated flooring oh and an amazing power showerthe hotel houses a very popular new york sushi restaurant the food was pretty decent the hotel is on the same street as the hudson hotel pay a visit to the bar and also the mo bar at mandarin oriental the view of the city is amazingall in all cant fault this hotel does everything a hotel should very comfy central location and excellent attentive staffwill be my new york sleeping spot going forward,Positive
in this area of nyc a hotel with less ambient music and vivid as the neighbours from the hudson breakfast and dinner was a bit disappointing for europeans but the rooms were fantastic spacious very clean quiet to go back,Positive
i decided the visit nyc for a friends party last minute columbus was offering a rate of total so i decided to check it outthe hotel is located at the southwest corner of central park directly across the street from the time warner bldg th ave is within walking distance as well as other typical nyc attractions it is very conveniently locatedthe hotel staff were absolutely charming everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating the hotel itself is well designed visually a sleek and attractive space my room was a quotpodquot room it was quite small as was expected but perfectly clean and well designed for its purpose the bed was very comfy as well my only critique involves the insulation of the room i was in room and the wind was quite loud you could also hear doors opening and closing etc i will certainly return to the hotel but maybe next time i will bring some earplugs,Positive
this hotel was brilliant on arrival the doormen asked for our names as we were a party of and took our bags inside when we were checking in the manageress came out and asked was it ok that she had upgraded all of our rooms as she had seen it was a girls holiday of course we said yesthe rooms were spotless and the beds and pillows were the most comfy i can ever remember in any hotel ive stayed ineach night the room was turned down and towels toiletries and water was replacedit was so close to central park and the time warner building across the road has some nice shops and i would definitely recommend the porter house restaurant in there toowe got great rates for this hotel on quikbookcom and if i am lucky enough to get back to nyc id definitely stay there again well worth a visit,Positive
it was a busy week in ny and i had trouble finding a room at a good hotel im picky so i decided to give columbus a try the staff is well trained the doorman asks your name when he takes your bag and then radios inside so that you are greeted by name at the desk as i came and went from the hotel i was always addressed by name i arrived around pm and they were able to provide a room then i had a queen deluxe room it did face the narrow alley but i would much prefer that to the noise of th street there is no view on th it is a narrow street and looks onto the glass building of the timewarner center the room size is typical of a ny boutique hotel small but comfortable and well appointed id rather have a smaller nicer room than a large yucky room if you want large and yucky i can give you that list everything is new and clean which is always a plus there is a small wardrobe instead of a closet so dont overpack but it is adequate the bathroom is small also i had one with a tub but manageable once you figure where to put things it might be a little cramped for people depending on how well you like each other the doors are heavy and do slam loudly so in the morning if you are not an early riser youll probably hear them each room has its own central acheat which is nice and not the norm in new york unless it is a new building or completely renovated you dont have much temperature control in many ny hotels i like having my room cold at night and toasty in the morning so i appreciate the unit but i do have to mention that the fan is very loud but it makes for good white noise for sleeping and drowning out slamming doors the pictures on the hotels website are accurate there is a japanesesushi restaurant in the hotel which was good but when its not open you have to go out which isnt really a big deal but if you like to have room service in the morning this isnt the hotel for you there is coffeetea and pastries in the lobby until am but you have to fetch it yourself i have stayed atchecked out many hotels in the area and this one is probably one of the nicest the peninsula and fs are my favorites but taking a step down from those if this is the area you want to be in id recommend it since its a new hotel without much history you can email me if you have a specific question,Positive
i stayed at this place with my girlfriend for three nights after trying to find a place that would suite our needs for this trip for more than a week i finally came upon the on columbus we reserved a pod room due to our limited budget and were completely happy with it upon arriving we were greeted by extremely polite staff everybody working for the hotel was friendly and helpful throughout our staythe room was very clean nicely designed and comfortable for two people who use it as a place to relax after hitting the streets of new york in the morning we found coffee and a selection of good tasting baked goods in the lobby the location of perfect it is in walking distance to everything in midtown manhattan right on the sw corner of central park a subway station is across the street there are several shops and restaurants around we would stay here anytime again,Positive
my fianc and i spent a few days in new york during thanksgiving we had prebooked the hotel and profited from their quotbook early save moneyquotprogram our room was in the th floor sadly staff had forgot about my request to have some sparkling wine in the room so we didnt have that on arriving but that wasnt a big problem as the hotel offers complimentary wine from pm every night even with piano music on fridays the room itself was good though the bathroom was a bit small but very clean and nicely done we had a bit of a problem with the shower in the sense that the water spilled over the sides and it was nearly impossible to take a shower without splashing the bathroom floor that also wasnt a problem as we only had a shower in the morning and then were walking through nyc all day so we didnt care too much about the wet floor which was cleaned during the day anyway the reason we only rate this hotel as quotvery goodquot and not as quotexcellentquot is that the heating didnt work it was already rather cold outside and when we asked at the front desk if they could turn the heating on their reply was that the heating would be turned on automatically if temperatures dropped below fahrenheit which it didnt we did get a little electrical oven though so we were warm enough but we would have expected the heating to work in a rather expensive hotel ricks caf on the second floor really is like an extended living room with some wonderfully comfortable chairs and sofas we had our breakfast there and enjoyed a glass of wine every evening we loved the interior decoration of the hotel it is also very quiet despite being right on the edge of times sqaure for the thanksgiving parade we could really just walk metres from the hotel and were right in the middle of it all all in all id recommend the hotel id return again though i might get a bigger room next time,Positive
friendly comfortable spotless and loaded with extra touches what more could one ask for location right off times square in between great eating places fifty yards from the old town hall saw garrison keillor on saturday night around the corner from abc starbucks drugstores two or three blocks from the main broadway theaters and midway between the empire state building and rockefeller plaza thanks to all the contributors who pointed the way the hotel helped to make it a fabulous trip,Positive
im writing this review from the hotel using the free wifi greatly appreciatedthis is a charming hotel seconds away from times square not that yous know it from how quiet it is in our room its within easy walking distance of almost everything you could want to see and do and theres no shortage of fabulous places to eat and drink right through the day and night right outside your doorthe staff here are so nice and friendly and go out of their way to make sure youre enjoying your stay the rooms are comfortable and clean and even in a basic room i have a bathtub and plenty of closet space the little touches such as free bottled water in the room and the wine reception in the evenings really make this place stand out i would stay here again for sure,Positive
i agree with other reviewers that the staff is wonderfully solicitous and the lounge with breakfast and happy hour is lovely however i found the small quotdeluxequot room really small even for nyc and the queen bed suspiciously wee as well i could hear the doors in the hallway all night long interrupting my sleep i was trying to work as well and the internet connection while free was so slow it really wasnt practical to use other than looking up a single item on the interwebs occasionallythe price was really quite high i thought for a non peak stay and a very wee room with no view i appreciate the staffs efforts but there are better options for the price,Positive
the staff really go out of their way for everything its a cute small hotel just round d corner from times square rooms are lovely including breakfast tea coffee amp biscuits all times amp wine amp cheese in the evening couldnt have stayed at a better hotel,Positive
the location was greatstaff were attentiveroom was very good but a little modernizing would have been betterwould recommend,Positive
loved the location of this hotel walk out of the front entrance turn right and one minute later you are on tmes squareloved the complimentary breakfast and the evening cheese and wine fantastic way to start the eveningstaff were really friendly too rooms not particularly luxurious but then who spends any time in a hotel room in nyoverall well worth booking,Positive
myself and daughter stayed at the casablanca for five nights we cannot rate the hotel too highly the welcome the service the friendliness and helpfulness could not be faulted the rooms were delightful and the services and amenities plentiful the breakfast all day beverages and pastries and the wonderful atomsphere at the cheese and wine evenings was a really nice touch after a busy day the location was central you were totally aware of the street bustle outside the rooms were so well soundproofed yes we will be back for more of the same hopefully in the not too distant future mum lynn and daughter helen,Positive
the hotel is attractive the personnel helpful attentive and pleasant the hotel hosts a morning breakfast and an early evening cheese and wine buffet which are pleasant and reminiscent of b and bs rather than large city hotelsanother unusual feature is that the coffee rolls and cookies are avaulable in the common room throughout the day while the lobby is small but waiting time is spent in the second floor common room which is tastefully decorated in a north african motif the only shortcomming is the size of the rooms my interior room was small and cramped our luggage had to be placed on chairs as there was no room on the floor for luggage and room to walk the bathroom was similarly tiny and could not accomodate the personal items of two adults while the corner exterior rooms were larger management advised that our interior room was the standard in the hotel if you are not planning to spend much tiome in your individual room but rather in the large comfortable common room this is the ideal place,Positive
excellent location in times square with no noise problems ricks cafe is very useful for snacks between meals or a place to chill out after a long day shopping free internet also our room was a little small and worn but did the job staff very nice expensive but worth it for the overall package location unbeatable,Positive
enjoyed the service clean room complimentary breakfast for a weekend trip,Positive
from the moment we arrived until we departed the service was exceptional everyone was so friendly and helpful our room was extremely comfortable the bed was plush the bath room was very large we especially like the delicious snacks and fresh coffee available hours we were very near great dining broadway everything fun we could not have had a better experience for any price the only way it could have been better was if we could have stayed longer,Positive
we returned to the casablanca three years after staying there as a couple for our wedding anniversary we enjoyed it so much we promised our sons we would take them one daystayed for four lovely nights the hotels excellent standards and service have been maintained it was like wed never been away kids teenagers enjoyed it tootheres no need to repeat other reviewers comments regarding the contintental breakfast free cheese and wine endless free coffee and biscuits etc its all true and most welcome before and after a heavy days sightseeingour room was fine we were at the back so it was quieter last time we were on the front and it did come with some late night and early morning noise but it is central manhattan dont expect a view though whichever part of the hotel you are in the location makes up for it though it is sooo peaceful and relaxing even though its only a few yards from times squareoverall this is a great small hotel with very good service and friendly staff nothing is too much trouble whether its sightseeing advice an umbrella on a rainy day help with airport transfersetc we had an issue with the car company that we had booked through the hotel to take us back to jfk an email to the casablanca when we got back to the uk and they resolved the problem within hours even though they werent at fault in any way as and when we return to new york theres only one place we would stay,Positive
if you want to be close to the action and have a cleanquiet room with service with a genuine friendly attitude this is for you if you want a great view from your window in a cold impersonal sterile cookie cutter chain hotel look elsewhere no they dont have a bar or restaurant but you wont go hungry or thirsty at any time see emeneties once you walk out the door you can fall downdepending on which direction you fall your in a bar a restaurant or times square or all the above within walking distance of all major attractions in nyc but bring comfortable footwear ashphalt and cement do a number on your feet after a day or so and bring it is nyc its not never has and never will be cheap,Positive
we got an upgraded room with a queensized bed the room was a comfortable size as was the bathroom i found the room and the hotel to be clean the service was outstanding breakfast in the morning was excellent and having wine and cheese in the early evenings was very convenient for us my only complaint our room faced the street and a couple of nights we were awakened by construction noise at one of the adjacent buildings this was our first trip to nyc but we have travelled a fair bit throughout the world we will definitely stay at this hotel again,Positive
considering the fantastic reviews and the unique postion of the hotel near times square we deceided to book nights in this hotel as a start for our week holidays in northeast usa and canada when we entered the hotel i must say i was rather disappointed by seeing a very modest lobby and a bit worn interiors from the photos on the website i expected to see a very elegant hotel but it is definitively not the disappointment worsened when we entered our standard room situated on a small dark courtyard where aircos were singing their tune the room was absolutely very small and so was the bathroom we had two suitcases but could not find proper room for their storage the bed was very small too which was the worst i suppose having a room at the front of the hotel has other disadvantages streetnoise and besides that it appeared that no other rooms were available the plus of this small hotel is its size small boutique hotel and its nice sitting annex breakfast room you can watch tv there and there is a computer available for the guests as well the afternoon glas of wine and cheese is a nice extra and the breakfast included was very good however looking at the price they charge you for roombreakfast this is an expensive hotel i have no experience with other ny hotels and i suppose pricequality in this city is worse than in other cities i admit this hotel has a splendid position right nextdoor to times square and the size makes it attractive compared to the big touristhotels however it has its price which i said it before is too steep,Positive
i wanted a small boutique hotel in midtown and after reading the reviews on the casablanca decided this was the one for me i was travelling with my teenage daughter and felt that it would be to our advantage to be in a smaller hotel as it was more personal i was exceptionally pleased with the casablanca our room was on the th floor and fortunately for us was on the back of the hotel so we did not experience too much noise the only downfall is the view was an inner courtyard of airconditioning units but it was a small price to pay for a bit of respite from the madness of the city the room was immaculate and we felt of a good size for a city hotel room all members of staff were very friendly helpful and courteous and nothing was too much trouble although initially it seemed a bit pricey when you take into consideration the continental buffet breakfast constant flow of teacoffee complimentary cheese and wine in the evenings and the free internet service it actually is worth every penny the location is excellent just a couple of hundred yards from time sqa very warm friendly and welcoming hotel and when we return to nyc in the future we will be heading to the casablanca,Positive
if you are looking for a small quiet centrally located hotel with good prices this is the place for you we found the service to be outstanding the staff was incredibly helpful having a car arranged for us at newark and also with getting my wifes birthday cake up in her room on our arrival then they were nice enough to keep putting it in and taking it out of the fridge for us when you include all the free perks breakfast internet gym that a lot of other high price hotels dont include this place is even more of a gem the rooms arent huge but when were in nyc we dont spend a lot of time in our rooms anyhow ricks cafe makes for a great area to chill and relax when you do have a few extra minutes,Positive
we stayed at the casablanca during september and the first thought which came into our heads when we arrived is how relaxing and calm it was we were taken to our room on the th floor which didnt have a view but it was nice modern double with lcd tv seating area and modern bathroom it wasnt a massive room which i believe is typical of nyc but i thought the actual hotel looked even better than the photos on the website we booked a long stay is more rewarding package through the website which meant a good rate but also a bottle of prosecco on arrival and a credit towards a meal at the montenapo restaurant which is not far from the hotel we had a really good meal there nice food in very nice surroundings we just had to pay for a bottle of wine so the paid for the food on our first night we had a meal at tonys italian restaurant which is next to hotel and we really enjoyed the food just be careful how much you order as the portions are massive regarding noise we didnt have any problems at all everything was really quiet and comfortable ricks bar which is on the st floor is a great relaxing place to go for your free breakfast and snacks throughout the day there was nothing like having a busy day in nyc then going back after pm and having cheese and biscuits a glass of prosecco and some popcorn to relax and put you on until dinner later one thing which really does seperate the casablanca from other hotels is the service which is brilliant everybody was very friendly hard working welcoming and happy to help had a problem with the inroom safe one day and that was sorted out within minutes the room was kept pristine clean at all times and we could not fault the service at all in particular rafainha not sure of spelling was an absolute star she was a friendly face in ricks bar at the cheese and wine reception always smiling and being very pleasant to everyone then going round later handing out extra towels later in the day she really is a credit to the hotel i considered other hotels such as the sofitel and the marriott marquis before i settled on the casablanca and i was really happy with my choice the casablanca is not the cheapest hotel but when you take into consideration the location right off times square but in short walking distance to th avenue empire state etc free wifi free computerprinter to use free snacks throughout the day free cheese and wine and free safe in the room i think its one of the best deals out there,Positive
my daughter and i stayed here for nights there was a minor problem with our room which was attended to very courteously the room we were given was excellent it was very quiet not a great view but well worth a decent nights sleep the staff were exceptional i felt very comfortable at all times the breakfast in ricks cafe is a great bonus as is the teacoffee available on demand there too this was my daughters first visit to ny for her st birthday and the hotel acknowledged this as well thank you for making this a great trip,Positive
i did my research on ta and talked with the hotel several times before traveling with my wife to nyc for two nights we stayed thurs and fri and while the service at the hotel is very very good the hotel itself and its location has some question marks our biggest objection was how ridiculous the level of noise was coming from the street at night now granted i know we were staying right off times square but any rooms in the hotel that are to have any daylight a view facing the street are going to put guests in the sad position we were in we caught one early morning am of traffic garbage truck noise and then sadly for us one complete night of construction on the street while outside activities are not the hotels fault the fact that some ta reviews spoke of soundproof rooms is an absolute joke be prepared for noisy nights if youre on the street side if youre not youre likely to be in a dark room as even our room on the street side was quite dark and dreary and opening all of the blinds wasnt an option unless we wanted the office workers in the company across the street to see every move we made again im an experienced traveler and not used to complaining but i am not shy about asking for corrections and stating my opinion when i dont feel like im getting value the casablanca while having plenty of nice serviceoriented people is not a hotel located for those who might want some quiet relaxation i would recommend anyone who does stay there to stay away from rooms on the street side,Positive
i stayed at the casablanca hotel in early october for a business conference this is a small hotel that is on a relatively quiet street one block off of times square the rooms are relatively large for this area and very quiet the staff is very friendly and accommodating the amenities such as the great breakfast and wine and cheese in the evenings really set this hotel apart from its competitors the rooms are very clean and functional and include a decent cable tv package not that i spent that much time watching tv free wireless access is a huge bonus i highly recommend for business or pleasure,Positive
because of tripadvisors ratings we stayed at this hotel for two nights i could not wait to leave we had to ask housekeeping to come and clean off two huge spider webs over our bed the room was filthy it had not been vacuumed our white socks were brown after walking around in the room at the time we stayed it was reasonably priced the price now is outrageous for a run down hotel the breakfast was nice and the wine in the afternoon was a nice touch but for this price you can find a much nicer boutique hotel in a nicer location,Positive
its all been said before casablanca is a charming hotel with a great attention to detail and ambience ricks cafe provides a comfortable haven and a variety of food and beveragesthe staff are attentive and professional a pleasant atmosphere abounds and guests are made to feel welcome at any time of the day this consistency sets it apart from other hotels and is a credit to the all the staff it really is a group effort thank you for making our stay such a positive experience,Positive
we stayed at the casablanca hotel which we chose due to the great reviews from trip advisor the location was fantastic the rooms clean and the complimentary breakfast was wonderful we also enjoyed the complimentary winecheese at night which was much needed after walking around the city all day the rooms were small but adequate and clean i would definitely recommend this hotel as well as stay there again,Positive
very cozyclean boutique hotel in the madness that is times squarelovely touches such as free continental breakfast and free cookies coffee at anytime of the daythe wine amp cheese every evening was an especially lovely touchthe staff are extremely helpful and seemed genuinly interested in making your stay a happy onethankyou casablanca hotel for making my husbands birthday and our st trip to new york a one to remember for all the right reasons,Positive
the room decor was lovely very clean and the bedbedding was very comfortable the staff was very friendly and helpful from the beginning a few days before our arrival they called to ask if we needed any help arranging transportation to the hotel or had any questions upon arrival they were friendly and informative and accomodated our numerous inquiries throughout our stay the complimentary breakfast was of good quality and we enjoyed the atmosphere of ricks cafe there is also an open courtyard off of ricks cafe with or tables the location just off times square was convenient i agree with others that the air conditioning unit was a little loud but not disturbing we were on the th floor and did not hear outside noises the wireless internet worked well the robes and slippers and complimentary cookie samples in our room were nice touches we never did make it to the nightly wine and cheese social but we can attest to the fact that ricks cafe provided complimentary fruit and juice even at am weve stayed in three other nice hotels in nyc but now that weve experienced casablanca well never stay anywhere else,Positive
my husband and i had a lovely time at this hotel the staff makes you feel special the room is very comfortable with wonderful ammenitiesand the location is perfect we recomend this hotel to everyone and we will come back as soon as we can great,Positive
just returned from a week here and very impressed hotel location ideal for broadway theatres we found it was within walking distance of many areas of interest in manhatten but subway with wide line access very close on nd sttimes sq the included breakfast great selection of fresh bagelsbuns cereal fruit freshly squeezed oj etc and evening wine amp cheese were big plus factors especially with the relaxed friendly atmosphere and genuine warmth and attention of the staff theres hour access to coffee and cookies and free internet access including a terminal in the loungecafe cant really comment on the noise of the inwindow aircon as this was drowned out by nocturnal roadworks whilst we were staying i guess its a reflection on how relaxed we felt staying at the casablanca and how pleasantly exhausted by sightseeing and enjoying ourselves that even the am pneumatic drills didnt really bother usthey did clear away by our last night thoughwe preferentially stay at smaller quotboutiquequot hotels and have no hesitation in recommending casablanca would definitely stay here again this hotel deserves its high ta ranking,Positive
after visiting nyc for years for both business and leisure we have finally found our nyc home away from home we could not believe the website presented a true picture of the property from the moment we entered the lobby we had positive feelings the staff was professional and helpful every ammenity was excellent ricks cafe is a treasure the breakfast buffet and evening reception were excellent we even had the pleasure of the friday evening piano program we look forward to our next visit and have already recommended the casablanca to family and friends,Positive
in this beautiful hotel our second time staying here and this time uuas even better than the firstpossibly because it uuas for longerpossibly for other reasons our anniversary uuas very special and as far as i can make out the staf uuere very helpful in making arrangements for my partner to surprise me if you happen to read this honey please can uue go back o,Positive
if ever in new york city again i will definitely be staying here againwe choose to stay in a mini suite which was just fantastic my friend tends to wake up a little earlier than me so she could relax in the sitting room without disturbing me the suite was great the toiletries were fantastic the location was right at time square you really could not get a better location to experience downtown manhattan even though there was so much happening outside on time square the moment you step inside the hotel the noise of the street is left behind it really is a little gem of a hotelthe breakfast was very nice and the wine amp cheese each evening was a nice touch the staff are very friendly and helpful i would have to agree with the other reviews and say that the airconditioning was very loud but it certainly didnt interrupt our sleep unless you are a light sleeper this shouldnt be too difficult to put up withif i am fortunate to come back to new york city i will not even consider staying anywhere else,Positive
this hotel is excellent this was our second stay in two years and we were concerned that things at this hotel would not seem as good the second time round but they were the friendliness and yet professionalism of all the staff is amazing especially samuel who always seemed to be on duty and helping guests for the whole of our night stay the attention to detail cant be faulted and if you want a comfortable and quiet refuge that is in a perfect location just off times square which is ideal for subway links if you want to explore further and within easy walking distance of all the midtown sights if you are in nyc for a quick stay you will love his hotel and nyc and will want to come back again and again,Positive
from the interior to the staff every single one of them to the cleanliness of the rooms i found casablanca to be a delight the atmosphere is cosy the rooms gorgeous and the reception staff were so helpful to us providing us with city maps and detailing where we needed to go a few weeks later we returned to nyc and stayed in the tudor at the united nations which was more expensive and nowhere near as good as far as the staff were concerned wonderful hotel would recommend to anyone also literally seconds from times square perfect,Positive
together with my wife and our youngest sons of we stayed nearly a week in this hotel which is a few steps away from times square you would expect a lot of noise but our rooms were silent and o so nice and large for ny standards the staff is more than friendly and helpful and the whole place feels like you are staying with friends in the centre of town the hotel is small some rooms and that gives it an extra dimension breakfast is super and included and then there is a lounge with drinks and snacks throughout the day i have been staying at so many different hotels in all parts of the world but i would always go back to the casablanca which is a true star close to everything,Positive
my wife and i enjoyed a perfect night stay at the casablance during the first week in sept its location is ideal being literally a few steps from times square although the hotel seems so well soundproofed that you would never know it we found the breakfast buffet great for our needs and the evenings complimentary wine together with cheese and biscuits suited us ideally there is no bar as such but we found this an advantage the rooms had all required were immaculately clean if a little small all of the stakk we came into contact with were genuinely helpful and friendly we shall definitely return for our next trip highly recommended,Positive
i agree with previous reviewers its very good value for a midtown hotel and lacks the blandness and uniformity you get in big chains positives excellent friendly staff throughout clean rooms breakfast is generous and good quality the allday refreshments and evening reception are great dont be put off by the idea of a quotreceptionquot where you have to stand and make smalltalk with strangers you can just grab a drink and something to eat and sit down without needing to mingle but that said it is a friendly place and the ambience of the cafe is good and encourages people to be civil to other guests the internet computer is in the cafe so you can sit there with a drink and the printer was stocked and worked first time which is more than my printer at home does most of the time i had nonfeather pillows and quilt as requested negatives this sounds silly because if you book a hotel more or less on times square you ought to expect a bit of noise and lightbut the wooden blind didnt quite fit the window fully so i was disturbed on my first night by the flashing lights of times square coming into the room also i found the air conditioning a bit noisy i was confused about how safe i was in the case of a fire the only staircase i was aware of was in the middle of the building and all the corridors lead off it there seemed to be fire doors at the end of each corridor but at am i noticed these were all open so obviously they are not closed at night as i had anticipated they would be maybe they are the ones that close in the instance of a fire but id rather they were closed at night to keep smoke out a bit oddly in the first room i was in there was what seemed to be a battery powered carbon monoxide detector on the wall indeed its flashing light disturbed me but i was more concerned as to why they would need such a thing a mystery there was a wiredin smoke detector and what looked like a firesuppressor sprinkler system so overall i felt safe if anyone has more information about all this would be interested i admit i am shocked at how few tripadvisor reviews mention fire safety old fashioned tv with poor reception maybe you dont go to new york to watch tv but these days i think you just expect a better quality of tv screen and reception butthey moved me to another room which was bigger yippee and where the bed position meant i didnt get bothered by light this was kind of them as the hotel was busy i noticed however that as in the first room there was a crack on the bathroom floor it looks as if they may have replaced the toilets and the tiles had cracked in the process not a major issue and cleaning seemed good but something they can hopefully deal with eventually so overall a great hotel id happily stay there again and recommend it to others it has a real character of its own and a friendly ambience that speaks of good customer care,Positive
the employees were awesome and very respectful eat at tonys next door we ate there twice during our stay,Positive
spent nights here with my partner in july location is fantastic literally paces to the middle of times square rooms were pretty basic and small but thats what you get in manhattan i guess the buffet breakfast thing was very average with orange juice not being refilled and very little on offer if you put anything of your own in the fridge it automatically recognises the weight shift and charges your room so we had about incorrect items on the room bill also all in all it was a decent star hotel in a great location and the staff were helpful and friendly so as long as people know what they are getting and dont mind the price id recommend it,Positive
my husband and i stayed at the casablanca during our one year anniversary trip and loved every minute the room was a nice size with a spacious bathroom and closet as soon as your walk out the door of the hotel you are in the middle of busy new york step back in the hotel and it is relaxing and peaceful it was nice to have breakfast included in the stay and refreshments always available this is a first class hotel that i cant say anything negative about we cant wait to go back,Positive
we have just returned from out usa trip which included nights at the casablancafound and booked this hotel purely on the reports on ta we were not disappointed the hotel is a really nice small friendly hotel with fantastic staff who always went out of their way to be friendly and helpful we had a standard room which was fairly small but spotlessly clean and since we didnt intend spending much time there that was fine our room was at the back which was really quiet some earlier reports suggested noisy and inefficient air conbut ours was fine and actually we were so tired from our days walking around that a noisy system wouldnt have made any difference what was really nice while we were out at dinner our used towels were all renewed for the second time that day also bins emptied and room tidied over very nice touch breakfast was really nice the bagels especially the oaty ones were the best i have eaten yummy there was also pastries muffins bread boiled eggs and all the nice spreads and toppings to go with them all fresh and nicely topped up coffeee juice etc is cheese and wine time lemonade popcorn and other bits and pieces made this a real treat coffee biscuits and lemonade available hourssmall touches that made this hotel special such a peaceful spot just steps away from times sq we did eat at tonis next door on the first nightfood was good we did order just one main meal on advise of ta there was enough to fed at least such a shame to waste so much we didnt eat there again but did try the brooklyn diner at the other sidenice thin crust pizza and very convenientthanks everybody at the casa for making our stay special,Positive
we travelled to new york for a night anniversary getaway in august i had attempted to give my wife a surprise trip for the past year but something always changed my plans this time it workedshe didnt know where we were going until i passed her the boarding pass at the halifax airport we travel extensively and i always do my homework before i book i found the casablance hotel through a websearch i checked it out on this website and saw the great reviews the location was the clincher it is literally feet away from the time square new years crystal ball for a hotel that is so close to the action it is very quiet our room was a quotstandardquot it was small but more than adequate it had a full bath but a shower instead of a bathtub again this was sufficient since very little time is spent in the room i dont want this to seem like this is a substandard room it is just smaller than one would normally get ameneties cleanliness and layout were well above averagethe front desk staff were exceptionally helpful the room staff were very friendly the staff that ran the breakfast area were extremely friendly and were always there keeping the food well stocked and catering to any needs we had the breakfast buffet consisted of the typical continental fare everything was fresh from pm to pm there was the addition of wine and cheese i believe we only purchased one meal a day while in new york not because we didnt want to spend the money but because the casablaca offerings were more than enough i have to mention a great mexican restaurant that is located directly behind the casablanca villa pancho deliciousagain the location of this hotel is excellent there is a subway entrance one block south from there you have access to all corners of new york it is also in the heart of the broadway area a few blocks north and south and you have access to a multitude of shows the diamond district is just a few blocks away as is radio city music hall rockafeller center and macys we normally travel to the carribean but our next trip will definately be back to new york and the casablanca with our two kids and so that they can exterience this beautiful city thanks for the great experience casablanca,Positive
my husband and two kids visited casablanca hotel for the weekend and we had a great experience ricks cafe adds so much value to the stay especially when traveling with young kids the hotel is a couple of blocks from most broadway shows which is great because after the matinee we went back to the hotel for wine for the adults and lemonade for the kids and we relaxed before going out for dinner the mini suite was a good size and the amenities were fantastic the only reason why i did not give the hotel five stars is because the room was very noisy at night and the furniture was a little outdated aside from that we will definitely be staying there again,Positive
i travelled to new york in aug with my teenage daughter for five nights this hotel was ideally situated for us just off times square so we could walk to many of the attractions and quickly access the subway for others our room was very comfortable and just big enough for the two of us the air conditioning was effective perhaps a little noisy but after a few minutes you didnt really notice it the room was at the back of the hotel on the th floor no view but we could hear no street noise at all there is a computer with internet access in the cafe but this always seemed to be in use so we were glad that we had brought our notebook computer and made use of the hotels free wifi connection so my daughter could keep in touch with her friends at home we ate once in the italian restaurant beside the hotel and enjoyed the meal although the portions were huge it seemed common practice for other diners to take their leftovers home in doggy bags great for locals but not really practical for hotel guests go when youre really really hungrywe made good use of ricks cafe being english i need regular mugs of tea through the day to keep me going and my daughter particularly liked the popcorn and pink lemonade available in the evenings all the hotel staff were efficient and friendly and we felt secure and well looked after at all times,Positive
my wife and i stayed at the casablanca for nights in may it was a great choice recommended by friends back home in australia the location is fabulous literally doors from times square and yet the hotel is an oasis of quiet calm and comfort staff are attentive and seem genuinely eager to please the moroccan decor is more hollywood than new york but the public areas and guest rooms are clean comfortable and well maintainedwe were at the casablanca for two separate stays and had a different room on each occasion both were standard rooms and were reasonably sized with a good bed large wardrobe and spacious bathroom the air conditioners were old but workedbreakfast was included it was a cold buffet but the variety was good and the inclusion of hard boiled eggs made for a substantial start to the daydespite the location the hotel was very quiet and the neighbourhood safe with all the bustle and excitement of new york just a few steps away its an easy walk to all the broadway theatres no restaurant but with this location who careslike any ny hotel it wasnt cheap but we thought it provided excellent value we thoroughly enjoyed our stay would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is not comfortable with either the budget or luxury alternatives,Positive
we stayed at the belvedere and dream hotels in our previous stays to new york and the casablanca hotel far exceeded either of these hotelsthe location was terrific so close to the plays we did not hear any noise at all and had no trouble sleepingthe breakfast was great a very nice selection and very friendly service and a nice outdoor courtyard to eat in as well as a nice lounge with internetthe wine and cheese was a terrific compliment to a new york schedule after a day of sightseeing you can relax with a glass of wine and some cheese and fruit prior to going off to a play out of and we will definitely be back,Positive
great hotel right at the centre of the city and yet a peaceful haven to go back to the staff are helpful and informative and the breakfasts and evening snacks a real bonus this is an excellent base for exploring new york the subway is just across the street and time square just round the corner,Positive
literally steps from times square well ok steps but you get my point the location cant be beat it is a small cosy place excellent service from all the staff big smiles whenever you went into ricks cafe for breakfast or snacks ricks cafe was so nice we had a mini suite it was really nice the only reason i have given this ratings instead of is because the air conditioning is really noisy and there is not much natural light in the room,Positive
hello ive just recently come back from a night stay in new york staying at the casablanca hotel for the first time everything you read about this hotel is true and more from the perfect location great food throughout the day to all of the friendly staff who made our stay here the bestwe booked the mini suite for me my husband and my two children aged amp my daughter had one double bed and we had the other my son had the lounge area all to himself with a very comfy sofa bed amp tv our room had french doors that shut also with tv there was everything you needed in this room from free wifi hairdryer iron ironing board free safe toiletries dressing gowns and complimentary slippers there was a pc in the main hotel lounge for anyone to use all the food served was excellent from breakfast drinks amp pastries in the day to the cheese and wine in the eveningjohn and peter made our stay they helped with booking helicopter flights to local advice and sorted our transport back to the airportdespite being so close to the hustle and bustle of times sq the room was quiet id recommend this hotel to anyone you have to stay here if youre travelling to new york,Positive
great staff all friendly courteous knowledgeable great location feet to the nasdaq sign in times square the included continental breakfast should keep anyone happy the included wine and cheese bar and snacks in the afternoonearly evening are just the thing to relax after a day of exploring or to prepare for a night of entertainment the rooms are reasonably sized the bed was comfortable the bath was very nice except there was no good space to lay out the contents of a shaving kit our room looked out over rd street and it was a bit noisybut we both were able to sleep well would return in a moment and have already recommended to friends and our travel agent,Positive
the casablanca hotel is a very friendly hotel if you have any complaints the management team make sure they do the best that they can in sorting the problem your comfort is their number one priority ricks cafe on the second floor offers a range of food and refreshments which makes all the differnece and with the free complimentary breakfast you save a lot of money there are many resturants just a stone throw away for dinner the rooms are spacious with great air conditioning the hotel is very clean and times square is on your doorstep it is very central i will definitely be retuning to the casablanca in the near future,Positive
this hotel is just steps from times square but when you entered the front door you wouldnt know it our room was quiet and calming the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful they even had umbrellas for us to borrow one day ricks cafe was delightful coffee and tea hours a day breakfast was perfect we also like the wine and cheese reception my husband and i had a wonderful time and we will go back,Positive
superb hotel lovely lounge with marvellous refreshments seved in the early evening superb breakfast best fruit salad ive ever tasted the friendliest and most helpful of staff couldnt get a taxi to the airport due to the rain manager arranged for a limo taking him to queens to take us onto jfk at no more than a taxi fare brilliant the only complaint i could have was that one of the window blinds in our minisuite well worth the little extra over a standard room was broken and not fixed over days we were there but that is it and was no problem in view of the thick curtains also provided location is outstanding far better than we anticipated and probably one of the best locations for tourists in new york which coupled with the staff who are real gems for a new york hotel friendly and superefficient apart from that one niggling set of blinds make this for us the best hotel in new york we cant wait to return we had a brilliant time attending stonewall at and this hotel without question made this stay one of our best city holiday experiences my partner went to the nearby fitness club which provides complimentary sevices to the hotel and really rated it,Positive
everything stated on tripadvisor about the casablanca is true my husband and i celebrated our th anniversary here and they made our weekend very special we especially loved the complimentary wine and cheese reception which is everyday from mind you in ny a cheap glass of wine is about the highlight was the live music on friday a pianist namely james newman he was also a font of information about the ny jazz scene and gave us great advice about which jazz clubs were best what an interesting fellow to talk to we had pretty high expectations of the casablanca and our expectations were exceeded thank you for everything,Positive
recently stayed at this hotel the staff is incredible very very helpful with any and all requests room was very nice with some artdeco looks in it social hour and breakfast were great good selection and wonderful staff serving it in a terrific room my only complaint was that even though we were on the th floor the street noise in the evening was incredibly loud the room had a window ac which meant that we couldnt shut the window to eliminate street noise there were trucks making deliveries all night it seemed and this made it very hard to sleep if there were a way to eliminate the delivery noise at night this hotel would be perfect hotel is very close to times square,Positive
excellent location at metres from times square the convenience to all tour activities and theatres was great most staff were very obliging and happy to assist while the happy hour in the cafe provided a very enjoyable end to the day every day john s,Positive
perfect hotel in every way calm large rooms excellent staff excellent location,Positive
i stayed at the casablanca for one week in the middle of july with my wife and daughter age mainly because of the rating on tripadvisor and we were not disappointed even with extremely high expectations we had an amazing week the staff was excellent very friendly and helpful ive been all over the world in both and star hotels and never seen a hotel staff this professional and friendly they were genuinly happy about their job and their customersguest the room was with a king bed and we also got a crib for our daughter the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was nice but a bit small the location of this hotel is excellent for anyone wanting to explore manhattan only about meters from times square we actually didnt use a taxi all week just walked around to central park etc and used the subway when necessary not oftenthe style of the hotel was very nice my daughter loved the tiger statues and ricks cafe was great it was amazing coming from times square with thousands of people bustling around to the hotel were everything was quitet and calmi would really recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a great stay in new york,Positive
we stayed at casablanca from thth july and dont recognise the description given by a previous visitor no smells at all in our rooms and staff without exception delightful and helpful from our first contact with the hotel we could not have been happier we prepaid and thus saved this was a fantastic deal as we were coming out to nyc to get married and had booked a king suite and a premium room with double beds for the childrenwe arrived at casablanca in the late afternoon of th july and were given a personalised welcome by the front desk staff we unpacked and headed out to times square so close and yet so far the casablanca is really truly an oasis of calm as others have said we felt it every time we came back from our sightseeing and believe me we made the most of the day new york passes that we took out we saw everything it was great to come back to casablanca every day chill out in our rooms suite and premium and enjoy a couple of drinks and a snack in ricks caf before heading out for the evening all the staff were so helpful confirming our dinner bookings recommending restaurants and special thanks to john the gm for lending my son a belt on the day of our wedding when he realised hed forgotten his and even making an extra hole when the belt didnt quite fitthe rooms were wellequipped immaculately clean and the room staff almost invisible such was their efficiency if youre staying yds from times square theres going to be some noise but really nothing compared to other hotels in which weve stayed the casablanca is so individual and ricks caf is such a bonus but the level of service has to be what sets this hotel above so many others,Positive
this hotel is truely a hidden gem about steps from times square right around the corner from the abc studios and a very convenient subway stop the hotel staff is genuinely helpful and nice and even provide umbrellas for your use room at the back of the hotel is quite roomy and quiet there is a king sized bed two night stands and a cafe table with two chairs a closet dresser and airmoire with a large tv at the foot of the bed the room is actually larger than mine at home the sheets are very soft and the pillows just right i usually have difficulty sleeping in hotels but not here the bathroom is on the small side but again a tad larger than what i have at my own home there is a window air conditioner that you have total control over they provide plush robes for your use and complimentary slippers the breakfast reminded me of being in london ricks cafe lounge is a welcome respite any time of the day or night croissants breads bagels large variety of cereals fresh cut and whole fruits hard boiled eggs scones muffins fresh juice coffee decaf regular and flavored in addition to the lattecappucino machine which is available all day the nightly fresh cut cheese crackers fruit and wine are a great way to start the evening i wont stay anywhere else this is a true gem in the heart of midtown manhattan,Positive
i recently took my daughter to new york for her th birthday after reading the reviews on here i booked in at the casablanca i really didnt think it could live up to expectations but it did it is right in the heart of times square but the hotel is so gorgeous and so calm it is the perfect retreat after a day out in the city the staff are lovely especially the girls in ricks cafe nothing is too much trouble for them toasting bagels in the morning and making scrummy porridge with blueberries and strawberries on in the evening from it is cheese and wine which is fabulous and hard to not eat too much cheese and spoil your evening meal so be warned the hotel itself is immaculate beautifully decorated the only small thing i could moan about is that there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the room there is tea and coffee available all day long in ricks cafe but that means getting up and getting dressed before your first cup of tea of the day i found this very hard but maybe it doesnt bother others could be an english thing the other thing i would mention is that the rates they quote you do not include residents tax and another tax i forget what it was it did bump my bill up quite considerably it may well mention it in the small print but i must admit i didnt notice it and still cant see it anywhere so might be worth asking before you book if you are wondering about whether to book the casablanca or go for a cheaper hotel i would say book the casablanca any day of the week it is certainly worth paying a little bit more for the breakfast alone saves you a fortune as nothing is cheap in new york thankyou hotel casablanca for making our stay in new york absolutely wonderful oh yes nearly forgot to mention tonys the restaurant next door is wonderful not to be missed,Positive
cons very small hot humid room with a loud window air conditioner that kept the room hot until about am then the room would be too cold and the hallways were always hot the housekeeping staff used some heavy perfumed spray that made it hard to breath especially in the hot hallways and i came back from vacation with a sinus infectioncold i believe was because of this no exaust fan in bathroom and window quotviewquot was of a solid wall of a building when going to theaters had to walk past adult mens club that is just down the street from the hotel and sometimes women that quotworkedquot there would be standing outside the door pros nice breakfast included as well as wine and cheese reception in the evening this was in a large area on the second floor hotel is just steps from all the action of times square and the police station most of hotel staff was professional and friendly,Positive
good friends recommended this hotel and i am so glad they did not only was the location great but the hotel itself was a jewel it was cozy but spacious and offered so many of the amenities of larger chain hotels but with an intimate family feel the staff were the most accommodating and helpful i have yet to meet we stayed in a suite which was roomy and clean ricks cafe offered a balanced breakfast and the availability of beverages and snacks throughout the day was a nice pickmeup the staff peter in particular was most helpful in getting excellent show tickets for us i would definitely stay at this hotel again it was lovely,Positive
my husband and i stayed at the casablanca for five nights and have just got home the staff at the casablanca are wonderful they cannot do enough for you and make their guests feel extremely special of all the hotels i have ever been i have never felt so at home as the casablanca it truly is an oasis in the middle of the city with times square literally steps away the room was beautiful we stayed in room premium king and it was great the bathroom was spacious and the toiletries were of high quality it had everything we could ever want ricks cafe is perfect for relaxing checking your email complimentary internet and the breakfasts were excellent we will not stay at any other hotel in new york casablanca will always be our new york hotel,Positive
we stayed a week in this small hotel and it was a wonderful experience the staff were friendly and helpful a good continental breakfast amp there is all day coffee and cookies the best plus was the free wine and cheese each evening we went the first night and didnt miss the rest of the week as it was so nice to talk with other travelers and learn of their experiences in ny picked up many tips of where to go for the best deals etc this hotel is very good value has a first class italian restaurant next door free use of hotel computer and is metres from times square would not stay elsewhere but would go for a deluxe larger room next visit l amp m macaskill new zealand,Positive
what a wonderful time we had in ny a pity we could only stay for days but when we return one day we will definately stay in the casablance hotel again the location is excellent steps away from times square walking distance from th ave macys the empire state building and central park the staff was very helpful and friendly breakfast was delicious and our room was beautiful and spacious we looked forward to return to our room after a day of sightseeing the best part was the price we stayed for cheaper at the casblanca hotel than we would pay for a room at any star hotel in south africai highly reccommend it,Positive
we spent two nights in the casablanca hotel the location was wonderful right off broadway the service was impeccable anything you asked for was provided in an instant their lounge called ricks cafe was wonderful it is large and is always stocked with hot and cold drinks cookies and all sorts of exotic coffees the continental breakfast each day was beautiful and delicious the evening receptions with wine champagne cheeese etc was delightful as was the piano player on friday evening after a weeklong trip around ny and pa it was an oasis in a wonderful busy city the only downside was that there is no central air conditioning so the inwindow ac was a little noisy got used to it after the first nightan additional treat is quottonyquot italian restaurant right next door,Positive
i selected this hotel like others on the strength of the great reviews on this site i was planning a surprise anniversary trip so obviously it was very important that the hotel was pretty special i am very glad to say that the casablanca hotel lived up to expectations this is the first review ive written i felt so stronglythe location i wont go over again as so many others have however i have been to new york several times and had some trepdiation over being so close to times square however theres no need to worry it is frankly astonishing how close it is and yet how serene and quiet the decor is somewhat strange obviously i understand the references to the famous movie but nonetheless it is slightly strange to have murals of morocco over the stairwell however we found this to be an enjoyable quirkthe staff are all brilliant without exception unfailingly polite they always made a real effort to assist us in any way and took the time to learn our names why we were there what we were planning on our trip excellentthe breakfast in ricks cafe was very good a strong range of pastries bread products juice and drinks i relish pretty much anything american and thus was overjoyed to discover they serve hazelnut coffee for breakfast yeswe were booked into a standard double i had asked for a quiet room and sure enouhg ours was round the back with a window onto the fire escapes which i was expecting and had no problem with it was very quiet indeed only a gentle hiss of traffic like you get in any city the bathroom was excellent and the room itself small but well appointed however the only serious gripe i had with the casablanca was the aircon system they had one of the ubiquitous freidrich aircon systems the ones where the back end sticks out of the open window and the front sticks into the room the problem was that this was rather noisy we had to choose between having difficulty sleeping due to noise or heat given that i have seen many slimmer quieter and smaller air con units in other hotels i would really have thought that a hotel of this quality and price would have done a bit betteroverall i would highly recommend the casablanca for anyone staying in new york its incredibly easy to get to and a lovely place to seek refuge from the city its a bit too expensive for me to make it a regular occurrence but if you can afford it go and have a brilliant tripone tip do your research with where best to book at the time i booked february they had an quoteconomic stimulousquot package which included preferential room rate and free mug bathrobe and prosecco on arrival and who wouldnt want a bathrobe they are very fluffy however the proviso was that you had to pay upfront however after some snooping i found that venere who i had never used before gave me the deal but allowed me to pay on check out thus saving not only lost interest but a clear on an improved exchange rate,Positive
my husband picked this hotel because of the great reviews already on trip advisor and it lived up to them the location is fantastic especially if youre a first time visitor to nyc right in the heart of times square it doesnt get any more central the staff in this hotel are outstanding so friendly and so helpful the manager even sent a bottle of prosecco to our room to welcome us after we told him of our last disastrous trip to nycthe hotel is really nice it has a warm and comfortable atmosphere my only criticism if i had to have one is the bedrooms are typical of new york in that they are a little small and dark however what they lack in size they make up for in hospitality bath robes slippers cotton buds sewing kit even chocolate plus all the usual toiletries the list is endless there is a reception every evening in the lounge where you are served complimentary wine cheese and popcorn it was such a nice way to relax after a hard days sight seeingthe breakfast is also served in this cafe lounge in the morning and has everything you need i wouldnt recommend the eating places next to the hotel theyre pretty poor and overpriced jump on the subway next to the hotel and eat at some of the fab places further out insteadi would definitely stay in this hotel again and thank the staff very much for being so friendly and for their attention to detail,Positive
stayed for two nights in july when my single room wasnt ready vinnie got quite embarrassed needlessly and quickly upgraded me free to a king which was comfortable with a spacious bathroom nice complimentary breakfast buffet and wine and cheese in comfy secondfloor lounge and good deal on parking right next door the staff was unfailingly gracious and accommodating and employees i had never met were addressing me personally by the second day the service staff was friendly and cheerful despite being just steps from times square its very quiet as soon as you step inside the hotel great value in nyc id stay there again in a heartbeat,Positive
this hotel has an excellent location on times square the rooms are comfortable and offer all the necessary facilities we really liked the hotels style and theme the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and a lovely breakfast was available every morning i would recommend this hotel to anyone for location and service,Positive
just returned from a wonderful stay at the casablanca from checkin onwards the service was excellent the staff were always ready to advise on where to go how to get there etc ideal for a first time visit to new york we stayed in a mini suite which was ideal for myself and teenage boys the rooms are not huge but are very comfortable and clean with everything you could want ours faced out the back no view but very quiet the room was a bit warm the first night then i worked out how to use the air conditioning the free internet access in ricks cafe was very useful too breakfast was good and the cheese and wine in the evening is a lovely touchthe location is excellent just steps away from times square yet so quiet and peaceful in side only one word of warning if you eat at the italian restaurant next door dont even attempt to eat an entree by yourself the portions are huge the waiter did warn us but we still went ahead and ordered on eachwould definitely recommnd the hotel and would stay there again,Positive
very nice hotel in the heart of manhattan just minutes footwalk away from time square perfect hotel for a city trip with shopping sightseeing and nightlife if you want high speed internet all daynight long its for free the breakfast is very good included fresh fruits fresh croissants coffe cappuchino cerials fresh bagels honey jam creamcheese etc enjoy lunch or dinner at tonys nice italian restaurant neighbour they have the best we will return,Positive
ive visited new york city on several occasions but was keen to find a very convenient hotel central location extras etc for my husbands first visit to the city after reviewing the comments on tripadvisor i knew i wouldnt be disappointed this hotel is in the absolute best location with many of nycs best tourist attractions within walking distance i was amazed how quiet it was when moving from the craziness of times square to our superior hotel room the wine and cheese each evening was a bonus as was the complimentary internet access yeswe had to work on holidays we will definitely be back and ill be sharing this wonderful hotel property with all my friends heading to nyc,Positive
we were a group of ladies going to new york just for fun found this hotel by chance and we were very pleased with it just off the corner from times square and within walking distance to many things the staff were both friendly and helpful small enough that you were recognized and acknowledged each time you left or returnedthe rooms were nice strongly suggest the suite would stay here again,Positive
checked tripadvisors reviews before booking this hotel checked out of hotel had a fantastic experience very friendly and efficient staff brilliant location ample breakfast and cheese and wine tasting was excellent our daughter lives in new york at the moment was welcomed to have breakfast with us and participate in the winecheese tasting we stayed in standard room although not very big was as described in hotel literature so was not an issue computer and printer available for residents use in ricks bar on second floor outdoor veranda garden no negative comments definitely stay here again on our next visit to new york,Positive
stayed for nights in june hotel is literally steps from times square service throughout was wonderful and extremely accommodating all the front desk people seemed to learn my name notwithstanding my brief stay ricks cafe is a nice touch offering breakfast and through out the day refreshments my room was not fancy but it was not too small and it was well equipped with an air conditioner a dvd player and a ceiling fan free wireless internet in room and in ricks cafe is a nice touch the italian restaurant recommended by the hotel had wonderful food and service i can strongly recommend that as well i have already booked to return to the casablanca and think it will be my home base in new york as long as it does not become too pricey,Positive
we received tremendous service loved the nd floor ricks cafe still cannot believe how easily we moved from crazy times square night life to our peaceful hotel we will return,Positive
very pleasant and nice hotel especially the people who work there make it so pleasant much praise for the staff thank you when i am next in new york wants me back to your stay,Positive
impeccably clean top notch decor great staff ricks cafe helps as a place to sit given that the rooms are small they serve an excellent buffet breakfast and very good evening snacks so close to times square that rooms in front can have a real noiseneon problem but thats the trade off for being able to walk to shows the restaurant theyre affiliated with montenapo is lovely and serves excellent italian food guests have access to a fitness center nearby,Positive
the rates are steep but the quality is for the most part very high it is spotlessly clean the service is excellent and the facilities are best in class for a small hotel it provides a very superior continental breakfast experience with quality food including good cheeses and eggs along with great coffee my only rub was that our room was small and hot and we were unable to get anyone to fix the air conditioning over several days the attached restaurant features good home style food where one serving is enough to feed an entire normal size family so be forwarned,Positive
spent nights at the casablanca mostly first class although there was a mix up with the allocation of our room upon arrival which was eventually rectified ricks cafe is excellent with the complimentary breakfast plus coffee and light refreshments available throughout the day the one drawback was that our room faced the front of the hotel which is west rd street there is a building opposite which takes deliveries during the night and the noise was pretty bad i would stay at the hotel again although would insist on a room that did not face the street the location is perfect however turn right out of the hotel lobby and times square is yards away,Positive
as you walk yards from times square you walk into this perfect little gem of a hotel you are welcomed as if youve been a guest for years it was our first visit the front desk couldnt be more helpful with information the staff in the cafe are so friendly and finally the room staff make you feel as if you are the only people they are looking after the decor is tasteful and in keeping with its moroccan heritage a little gem that one would want to revisit sometimes its nice to keep a secret to oneself but without other peoples reviews we wouldnt have learnt about this hotel so there you go visit and enjoy,Positive
what a great location on top of that the convenience of breakfast and afternoon snacks made this a wonderful place to meet family and friends who could assemble before and after daily activities rooms were clean and quiet i will definitely come back,Positive
we stayed for four nights in the casablanca hotel its location is excellent two minutes from time square the staff were friendly but not overbearing we had a room at the back of the hotel which was good as it served as an early evening oasis of tranquility after the frenetic pace of the mornings sightseeing or shopping allowing us to recharge ourselves before heading out again to explore new yorks many attractions,Positive
i cant find anything important to criticise this hotel on our minisuite was in good oder the sofa bed slightly stained and the room was only set up for people not this tiny fact was sorted out in less than seconds from phone call to arrival of towels etc the staff couldnt have been more helpful especially vanessa on reception and keith on the desk at night nothing was too much trouble from finding out bus and train routes to places to recommending and booking restaurants the lounge with houraday coffee tea buns biscuits and fruit was a god send and the breakfast and cheese and wine were excellent a great start to the evening was a couple of glasses of proseco and then the town directly on your doorstep awaits i really recommend the spice market restaurant in the meat packing district the location of this hotel for a tourist is second to none i just left the teenagers i was with to it everywhere was so easy and safe busy to get to all attractions were visited and easily accessed this is where we will stay every time we visit ny,Positive
i travelled with my partner and friends and had the casablanca recommended by my friend who is also a travel agent we were cautioned that the room with two people in would be small but that the parlour style room for three had a separate lounge areasimply put it is in a great location being odd metres walk to times square but out of the noise and lights that you hit at the end of that walk the staff were all friendly efficient and helpful the included breakfast and wine and cheese evenings were lovely and the rooms well renovated and welcomingthe only thing that we found offputting was the slightly noisy airconditioner in our room no fitness centre onsite but you could get free passes to one just down the streetif you like oldschool class with a modern touch style thats not sterile and a welcoming place to come home to after mixing it with the mayhem the casablanca fits the bill,Positive
i had known about the hotel for some time before actually staying there and had heard very positive things upon making a spurofthemoment decision to stay in manhattan late on a saturday evening we had enjoyed a wonderful day and didnt want to leave i remembered the hotel called and that was the start of an absolutely firstrate experience the rate was good the service impeccable the decor and room far exceeded my expectations dont let the typically small manhattan entryway fool you once you enter the hotel and pass the front desk guests are treated to a very spacious and wonderfulldecorated environment you honestly have no awareness that you are right in the middle of the maelstrom that is times square its almost strangely insulated the staff were unquestionably excellent check in was fast smooth and extremely courteous we were personally shown to our room which was wonderful and a huge surprise since we were expecting the normal shoebox room one normally finds in manhattanthe next huge surprise was breakfast included in the room rate and a wonderful spread served by welcoming and helpful staff all in all i could not have asked for a better stay in any hotel in manhattan or anywhere else this hotel should be on the tripadvisor list i cannot speak highly enough about it,Positive
the casablanca hotel simply has the best staff around from the planning stage of our trip starting in january to our last minutes in nyc the staff has been helpful friendly and welcoming the hotel itself is quaint and well located our group of four had two minisuites that were perfect in size my grandmother needed a wheelchair after all the walking the first day and the hotel gladly provided one for us ricks cafea great breakfast and evening wine and cheese retreat has the ambiance full of class we also enjoyed the adjacent quottonysquot restaurant for dinner and drinks fabulous location fabulous staff fabulous vacationwe couldnt have hoped for better,Positive
my year old daughter came here last year with her dance studio and it sounded so wonderful i wanted to come my sister met us for part of the trip i had been warned about high prices and small rooms for the times square location i thought the room was very comfortable and i cant say enough about how wonderful ricks cafe was it was a huge benefit cost wise to have breakfast and snacks it was also very interesting to talk to the other guests about things they had done and places they had been the staff was also very helpful i loved this place and was sorry to have to leave,Positive
i booked this hotel for a day trip to new york for my mother my husband amp i i based the reservation purely on the great reviews on trip advisor it did not disappointour rooms were perfectly clean and were kept that way throughout our stay with our towels replaced up to twice a day if we needed as the hotel also had a turndown service in the evening the only down side was that my husband and i found the bed a bit on the small side for of us we had a queen bed room but we coped finericks cafe is the star of the show its nice and relaxed hours a day breakfast is good although we thought that it could do with more high tables rather than coffee tables as its difficult to eat breakfast from a coffee table if there are no other tables available we found ourselves coming back to the hotel for a quick cup of tea the best we had in new york and a rest from the madness that is times square we also enjoyed the wine amp cheese in the evening all the staff were helpful and attentivewe met mr taboada the general manager of the hotel and when he found out one morning that we planned to shop that day he pointed us in the right direction for the best places to go he also arranged for a car to take us back to the airport at the end of the trip which turned out to be a stretch limo a free upgradeits true what everyone says the casablanca hotel is an oasis in the middle of manhattan you truly cannot believe that you are steps away from times sqaure from the moment that you walk into the lobby it is quiet and so relaxedit is expensive but we found that the having the location the lounge and the lull that it gave us from the frenetic city were definitely worth the extra dollars,Positive
we spent two nights in this hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes luxury the bedroom we had was quite compact but had everything you could possibly need the staff are extremely helpful and go out of their way to accommodate their guests the room was very clean and comfortable there was an excellent choice of breakfast items i had the special k with fresh fruit and in the evening the cheese and wine is a great way to start your night it is just around the corner from times square although it manages to convey an atmosphere of serenity when inside the buidling the decoration is wonderful and it is worth paying a bit extra to get such excellent service,Positive
i chose this hotel based on other trip advisor reviews and can only echo the praise the service is absolutely superb thanks especially to peter and vanessa at the reception who helped me book tickets always volunteering information re the best routes or what subways to take the staff at at ricks lounge too were friendly although sometimes even quottoo efficientquotthe minute you step away from your seat your plate or drink is gone the lounge makes a huge difference thats where youll get to chit chat with people over a glass of wine or champagne and they also have beverages available at other times including my favorte coffee overall i cant speak highly enough of their efforts the rooms are fairly small but tastefully decorated with all the essentials and little extras that make your trip special chocolate complementary water bathrobes etc i usually dont use hotel bathroom products but loved the ones here the only complaint about my room was that it had a pretty loud ac but since it didnt really get that warm it wasnt really a problem ive only given for value for money because nyc itself is twice as expensive as any major city in europe for example so the hotel is expensive by most standars although quotmoderatequot for nyc id go back in a nanosecond,Positive
just come back from a four night stay the hotel location couldnt be better right in times square but very quiet inside our room was lovely quite small but comfortable breakfast was lovely and the staff couldnt do enough for you we found because of the hotel location it was ideal to pop back to the hotel to refresh and have a coffee always available in the lounge area and a pastry or biscuit also the cheese and wine in the evening was great very friendly atmosphere and a nice way to start your evening outwe couldnt fault this hotel and would definately go again,Positive
we took our year grand daughter to new york for her first visit the city is big busy exciting and loud and we loved it however the peace quite friendliness and hospitality of casablanca was most welcomed at the end of the day all three of us looked forward to wine and lemonade cheese and fruit that was offered in rics cafe at the staff is one of the best ive ever experienced and we travel a lot,Positive
i stayed there with my partner at the end of may it was our first trip to new york the hotel is in a fantastic location literally steps from times square we asked for a room at the back and got a room that faced inwards towards other rooms this was in no way a problem as we couldnt hear any noise at all and we reasoned that we didnt need a room with a view as we didnt plan to spend too long in the room too much sightseeing to do the hotel staff were fantastic very professional and courteous breakfast was included and was a cold continental buffet which was more than ample each night they provided cheese and wine which is a fabulous idea a great way to prepare for the evenings activities and also meet other guests and swap stories and recommendations we shall go back to new york one day and wouldnt consider staying at another hotel,Positive
my brother and i decided to go to see the big apple for the first time having read the reviews of the casablanca we thought that it would be a great place to stay but we didnt expect such a fantastic experience the staff were exceptional friendly helpful and even thought of things that we didnt ask about our first night we were even given free theatre tickets our stay was fantastic so quiet which was surprising as the hotel is one door away from times squarebreakfast in the mornings is awesome there is a huge range of foods for every taste and throughout the day ricks has free drinks and snacks at night there is cheese and wine for guests and there is heaps not one piece to share you even get a block of chocolate every day nothing sweeterhaving traveled around europe se asia and beyond i have experienced some of the best and worst but the casablanca has to be the best kept secret lucky i rely on trip advisor or i would have never had the pleasure love the casablance i will definitely be back,Positive
my best friend and i stayed at the casablanca before and after a college reunion trip since were on different sleeping schedules we opted for one of the suites which we found to be large and perfect for our needs i think what theyve done is to combine rooms into one since the sitting room is the same size as the bedroom this gave us ample drawerdesksitting and closet space the bedroom in the suites comes either with a king bed or in our case double beds which were very comfortable each with pillows in a choice of firmnesses room seemed to be a bit bigger with a bigger closet than which we stayed in on our return trip we requested an empty small fridge to put leftovers in from the cooking classes we took mornings and evenings which they provided at nocharge this was separate from the minibar robes and slippers are provided and there are nice bathroom amenities theres a chocolate bar on your pillow each night in addition to the breakfast and wine and cheese from pm there is also coffee tea water fruit and cookies available on the second floor hours there is one computer with a printer to print your boarding passes or whatever the staff is sooooo nice especially the young women in the breakfast room even though times square is yards from the front door the hotel is very quiet grand central and penn station are within walking distance unless you have a lot of luggage one word of warning the upper floor stairs are narrow i took a tumble trying to balance a full coffee take the elevator if your hands are full there isnt a fitness center on site but they offer one with a lap pool if you want to walk a few blocks,Positive
this was our second stay at the casablanca hotel and we enjoyed it just as much as our last stay it is a place where you can really feel comfortable and at home away from home staff was very friendly and courteous the room was spotlessly clean and had all the amenities you can wish for sitting down at ricks cafe to have wine and cheese in the evening was so relaxing and what we very much enjoyed was the atmosphere of generousness i will not repeat all the other glorious details that have been told many times but i think it is ok to point out some minor flaws for one thing the rooms we stayed at are really small beautiful but small and there is not enough space where to put your clothes at least if youre staying for a week like we did but then i guess the rooms are too small for an extra shelf or cupboard or chest of drawers then the air condition is very noisy so we could not keep it on at night which was rather unpleasant what i a european woman also never understood was how the shower works turning the handle to the left to the right up or down whatever i did the water always came down on me unexpectedly and last but not least we found it a bit disturbing at ricks cafe to have the tv on all the time and at the same time there was classical music playing considering the hustle and bustle of nyc we would have been grateful for a bit more quietnessnon of this made our stay less pleasant but without it it would have been just perfect,Positive
this is the most perfect boutique hotel my husband and i love to stay in the heart of cities yet in small hotels where we know the staff by the end of our tripand this is exactly that you literally step outside and you are right where the ball drops on new years it is right in the middle of manhattan so you are fairly close to all the major attractions andor subway lines to get there although we spent very little time in times square it was awesome getting to walk outside and get a feel for it while heading to a different part of manhattan our room was small but that is much expected in the middle of new york city but it really had everything we needed and super clean the friendly staff was great and gave us hints and tips that definitely made our trip better it is such a small yet classy and sophisticated hotel that is just steps from the craziness of times square and you dont even hear the hustle and bustle from your roomi think one of our favorite features about this great little hotel is the wonderful and complementary breakfast and afternoon cheese and wine all included in your very reasonable rate is an abundance of tasty food and beverage twice a day if we were not on vacation in ny to eat at all the wonderful places or if you are on a tight budget you literally could eat a large breakfast there and then go back in the evening and load up on popcorn cheese breads crackers veggies and wine and not spend a dime during the day on food,Positive
this hotel is fantastic it is right in the centre near times square and within easy reach of all the sights the staff are excellent each and everyone of them are very friendly and welcoming and go out of their way to help breakfast is included in the rate and is served in a lovely setting easy chairs papers and with a beautiful courtyard leading off free internet access is available for all to use they serve complimentary wine and cheese every evening between and pm which is a lovely way to relax after all the sightseeing and to meet the other guests cant wait to go back,Positive
my wife and i spent wonderful days at the casablanca could not ask for more or better parking next door at reduced rate excellent location time square clean comfortable and homey not ultra luxurious or pretentious just right with all of the small details that make this a special hotel the breakfast and winecheese were excellent and ricks cafe was a welcome and quiet break from the hustle and bustle of time square the staff was extremely helpful and always friendly and smiling we will return,Positive
casablanca hotel has everything a visitor to ny could possibly want or needeasy to get to central for sightseeing trips shopping shows proximity to times sq yet very quiet rooms very good service from every employee cleanliness a priority good breakfasts and free wine and cheese from pm served in attractive and unusual surroundings free internet books papers in ricks cafe only moan was that the coffee machine which provided good coffee broke down we would recommend this hotel to anyone and if you can afford to upgrade then do so as the standard room was quite small although adequate with very good bathroom hoho buses were very good as each bus had a tour guide who was very knowledgeable and interesting subway easy enough to use saw the marvellous wonderettes orsomething similar girls at prom in and reunion all familiar songs from s and s and absolutely brilliantan off broadway prod but veryy worthwhile especially if you are there to celebrate a th birthday ate at diner next door worth a visit,Positive
this hotel met all of my expectations and then some great location in the heart of time suqare to our delight and suprise we were upgraded to a larger room the customer service is outstanding and the rooms are very clean the breakfast is very complete and the wine and cheese in the evening is great it was very quite and comfortable we will definetly return and we may also try one fo theri other properties although we really like the casablanca,Positive
i loved this hotelwhen i first planned my trip to nyc i was hopingn to find a budget hotel my first choice was the pod hotel for about a night for a tiny room tiny bed no breakfast included and a shared bathroom luckily someone here on tripadvisor recommended quikbookcom and i got a great deal at the casablanca for a night sure it is not cheap but i got my own bathroom big and clean a spacious room with a queen size bed free breakfast everyday very good by the way and the best location in ny so i think it was worth every dollar i spentricks cafe is awesome as i said the breakfast is really good it includes fresh fruit cereal bagels muffins cookies yogurt orange juice tea coffee and the like also there is a cheese and wine reception every night from to one of my hotel favorites the bar is open hs seriously i got muffins at am one night the best part is that you dont have to pay extra for anything that you eat herethe staff is very friendly they are always happy to help with anything you need any time of the day and they are never grumpymy room was which is pretty quiet you dont get a view but you get a good night sleepi wont even bother to upload pictures of the place it looks exactly the same as the pictures on the web page no tricks thereconclusion i strongly recommend staying at the casablanca and for those who cant afford the regular price like me i recommend you check out quikbookcom,Positive
a special little hotel in the centre of times square this hotel lived up to all our expectations and made our holiday something to definetely remember service was very good staff very helpful champagne waiting in room for us on our arrival celebrating silver wedding rooms spotless but as our room faced back of hotel you could hear aircon units outside did not keep us from sleeping as we were so tired after visiting all the sights room service good lots of little touches ricks cafe was special coffee etc and cheese and wine every night was wonderful very relaxing hotel difficult to imagine that you can be a few steps from times square when you are sitting in ricks cafe would most definetely recommend,Positive
this was my rd time to new york my husband researched online hotels in ny amp we decided to go with casablancait got the best reviews from the moment we walked in the door the staff were friendly amp nice we stayed for nights from the monday th to th may i really liked this hotel very convenient to times square broadway for a show amp th ave for shopping cool location the room we stayed in was comfortable amp clean with a nice bathroom which was modern the nd floor has a lounging amp patio area which is where breakfast is serviced every morning in the evening times they serve cheese amp wine from here which we had one nightsadly we missed it most nights because we were out amp about the free tea coffee amp internet proved very useful when planning a days my husband amp i would definitely stay here again loved this hotel my one suggestion is to go with the king size bed rather than the queen size,Positive
this was our first visit to nycand we were not disappointed we spent nights at the hotel and from the moment we arrived to our sad day of departure we had an incredible timeour room was on the th floor away from the street the king size bed and spacious bathroom were greatly appreciated from the delicious continental breakfast to the complimentary water a real treat before starting your day of walking juice and sweets to the fun wine and cheese before setting out for the evening entertainment the staff and hotel itself never disappointed usstaying in this boutique hotel where the staff knows who you are and is attentive to your needs is the only way to travelthank you,Positive
i visit new york frequently and have spent time at many hotels in the city i have to say that the casablanca was by far the most convenient and the best value not only is it a very clean pretty hotel but its in the most wonderful location the heart of the theatre district its very pleasant dining room serves a wonderful complimentary breakfast and there is free high speed internet connections in the rooms also without extra cost true its rooms are small and you wont get the great new york skyline views from its windows but if you are a woman traveling alone or a couple with children this is a cozy safe environment filled with motivated staff members who really do care that you have a nice stay they couldnt have been nicer especially hassan i would definitely go back,Positive
this was my st time in ny and could not have been any betterthe casablanca hotel was chosen based on other tripadvisor reviews and i could not be happier the location is absolutely amazing times square on the doorstep broadway just therethe rooms were great and the whole atmosphere was excellent i hope i have a chance to go back to ny the hotel will be of couse the casablanca,Positive
i stayed in april for nights i will start with the positives this hotel is in a great location if you want to go to the theater a few times while in new york city the included breakfast is very good and includes fresh fruit salad cereals yogurt muffins bread and hard boiled eggs the bed was very comfortable and the noise from the street was not excessive when i used my silicone earplugs i did not hear the other hotel guests when i was in my room the rooms are very small in my room in particular the carpet was shabby and had some stains on it it needs to be replaced the blinds did not cover the window completely for privacy and although the window was facing inwards away from the street people were going up and down the fire escapes outside the room occasionally the television was against the left wall and not on the wall facing the bed so could not be viewed comfortably i had a shower in my bathroom and not a bathtub overall since i was planning on seeing plays in the evenings of my stay this hotel was very convenient but if this had not been my intent i think i could get a better hotel for almotst per night a few blocks away from times squarei did receive a request by email from the hotel management to give feedback about my stay and did reply with the above comments however up until now i have had no acknowledgement that they received my feedback,Positive
my friend and i stayed in a double room from may to may to celebrate her birthday from the moment we arrived until the moment we sadly left everyone there couldnt have been nicer the staff was tremendously friendly and helpful the room was great very comfortable beds nice bathroom with all the amenities great water pressure in the shower too very clean the best part was ricks cafe lots of choices for breakfast good coffee great wine and cheese every night a pc and the internet available for free i cant say enough about how pleasant and relaxing our stay was and the location was unbeatable we walked everywhere the show we came to see was only two blocks away the restaurant next door tony dinapolis was very good for the price plenty of other convenient shops and eateries just around the corner for all our other needs i was amazed at how quiet our room was at night no street noise whatsoever where we were very cozy it was like an oasis in the most bustling part of the cityi cant say enough about how much we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and found it to be worth every penny i definitely will not only stay here again ill only stay here whenever i come to ny which i hope will be once or twice a year from now on,Positive
the casablanca is a few yards from time square but you would never know it once you step inside you are greeted by the most attentive staff you can imagine the second floor lounging and patio area is fabulous complete with piano player and cocktails in the evening you feel like you have entered another world when you leave the hassle and bustle of the new york streets and step into the comfort and tranquility of the casablanca from now on i wont stay anywhere else,Positive
the location of this hotel is perfect for anyone seeing a show on broadway it is such a short walk to the theaters it is amazing and the location though just a few steps from broadway and the hubbub or times square is relatively quiet there is a parking garage right next door and a diner on the other side if you are into that sort of thing there is a subway stop very nearby or a several blocks walk to grand central station so you can get to anywhere in the city by subway if you do not want to move your car it is not too bad of a walk to other major sites we actually took the subway to the metropolitan museum of art but decided to walk back through central park and past rockefeller center it was a long walk but definitely doablethe one thing is that the room is very small i understand that is normal for nyc hotels but for someone who has not stayed in an nyc hotel before i wanted to mention when people say small they mean small we had difficulty setting our luggage out as there was really nowhere to put it it was also hard to keep the toiletries in the bathroom as there was not much in the way of shelf or counter space no room for a chair so we had to sit on the bed i guess i was expecting the small room to be a bit bigger than it was trust me it is smallthe decor was really nice and the free wine and cheese really made the hotel it was nice to be able to just sit and relax in ricks cafe for a nice quiet break there was also a small outdoor area off the main room that was nice to sit in we never saw anyone use it other than us the days we were there so it was like our private dining area duing breakfastoverall this place is a great place to stay,Positive
this was my first trip to nyc i selected the casablanca on the recommendation from a friend i am so glad that i did the location was so close to theaters restaurants and where we met our tour buses the room was small but adequate and nicely furnished the best part of the casablanca is rickswe had breakfast there every morning and enjoyed the snacks throughout the day i would highly recommend the casablanca,Positive
what a wonderful hotel my fiance and i stayed for six nights in april for my th birthday and we couldnt have picked a better place to stay for our first visit to new york in fact staying at casablanca we felt like privileged members of an intheknow club and felt sorry for people who go to new york and spend their money on bland chain hotelswe found casablanca in the dk new york top ten guidebook and when we saw it was so highly recommended on tripadvisor we knew we had to book i was hesitant about staying near times square because of the noise and crowds but as other reviewers point out you can barely hear a thing from outside the fact that casablanca is a relatively small hotel also makes for a calm atmosphere especially in ricks cafe which is a great place to unwind fantastic after a day pounding the streets of nyc the wonderful breakfast cheese and wine and complimentary snacks throughout the day all added to the great value of the casablanca but the highlight had to be the wonderful staff everyone seemed so pleased to have us stay there and were always smiling ready to chat and pleased to offer suggestions one morning i mentioned to john at reception that we were going out shopping and he promptly handed me a discount card for bloomingdales plus gave us some great tips for shopping downtown if you stay here make sure you ask for lots of tips on where to go as they will always be good onesi read a few reviews before we booked that mentioned the bedrooms are small we didnt find this to be the case and we booked a queen room the smallest there was plenty of room to move about lots of closet space and a lovely bathroom with very nice toiletries and gorgeous soft towels that were changed twice daily the temperature of the room we also found fine and the bed very comfortablethe only thing i would mention about the hotel is that it doesnt have a bar this didnt bother us at all there is complimentary wine between pm and plenty of bars around times square but i guess for some people this might be a disadvantage i found it made the place feel more like home to be honest but it depends what kind of experience you want from a hotel if you want excellent service excellent quality acccommodation and to feel at home as soon as you arrive then pick casablanca you will have a great time,Positive
we really enjoyed our stay at the casablanca our room was spacious and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful it was lovely to come back for cheese and wine in the evening served in a cosy drawing room the bustle of times square seemed very far away once inside this welcoming hotel wed definitely recommend it,Positive
the pleasant staff and phenomenal amenities made our stay very comfortable and relaxing we will stay here again,Positive
the hotels great location was ideal for walking safely to the shows i attended and for getting quickly on the bus the room was very clean and comfortable and the bathroom was modernized and spotless the staff couldnt have been more friendly and helpful the breakfast was a great convenience provided a lot of choices and was offered in a very comfortable nicely decorated room a nice way to start the day it was so pleasant to step out of the hustle and bustle of nyc into the comfortable ambience of the casablanca,Positive
the casablanca is the perfect place to stay after a long trip its so peaceful yet in the middle of everythingthe free tea coffee and internet proved very useful when planning a days sightseeing the breakfast was nice too and the rooms are big compared to what you expectthe staff were all very friendly and helpfultheres also a big supermarket across the road perfect for stocking up on all those yummy peanut butter themed american sweets which you cant get in the uk,Positive
me and my wife spedt nights at this charming hotel in april reading the latest comments on the hotel before we arrived i can strongly advise anyone to go to this hotel perfect location neartimes square but not noisy hotel is charming staff very friendly and helpful breakfast is simple but enough if someone wants more can have one in other hotels for usd per personhere its included in price rooms are not spacious but there is enough space i would not spend there weeks but for a few day more than enough they are clean and friendly summary best available hotel in this category for a reasonable price well be back if we can,Positive
omg this place was awesome thanks to john taboada the general manager and is wonderful staff everyone at this hotel made you feel special it was my friends birthday not only did they sing happy birthday to her but also presented her with a birthday cake you wont find that at a lot of hotelsi would stay here again in a new york minute the wine and cheese was excellent we had a suite and it was very nice and very clean this is definitly one of new yorks hidden gems,Positive
an excellent find the location is terrific just off times square convenient for all the major sights shops and shows the staff are very friendly and helpful nothing is too much trouble the rooms are spacious and well appointed with all necessary amenities this is a small hotel in terms of number of rooms which gives it a cozy family feel despite being next to times square it is not noisy the buffet breakfast included in the price was perfect for us though no hot food there is no restaurant in the hotel but it is not necessary as there are plenty of places to eat next door on either side and you can get room service from tonys italian restaurant the smoking deck is a lovely oasis free internet access and a printer always stocked with paper in the lounge was a nice touch plenty of free umbrellas for when it rains its not cheap but is great value for money we would highly recommend the casablanca for pleasure or business,Positive
just enjoyed a wonderful visit to new york city for theatergoing made relaxed and comfortable by the hotel casablanca this is a little gem of a hotel far more pleasant and personal than the huge nearby marriott marquis doubletree milford plaza etc ive stayed in them all and while the locations of these hotels are just a good for access to broadwaytimes square the hotel casablanca is more like staying in a lovely bampb in england the checkin and service are cozy and personal not like the frantic airport atmosphere at the big chains the rooms while on the small side all hotel rooms in nyc are smallunless you can afford a presidential suite are nicely decorated and comfortable as well as quiet which is a real bonus so near to neversleeping times square the bathroom with lovely moroccanblue tiles was unusually large and nicely appointed you enjoy the luxury touches of bottled water in the room bathrobes dvd players etc and the staff while not hovering over you were always available to do whatever you needed with quiet and pleasant efficiency whether it be to call a cab or recommend a nice play breakfast in ricks cafe was a real bonusmore than a simple continentalwith extras like hardboiled eggs and yogurts as well as good bagels pastries fresh fruit cereals and juices in short i would give a strongly positive recommendation to this hotel to anyone taking a trip to nyc especially if a calm and relaxed atmosphere is sought well done hotel casablanca,Positive
the casablanca hotel is a little of oasis of tranquility amidst the mayhem and madness of time square the hotel is a few steps from time square but you you would not know this once you are inside the staff are very helpful and the customer service is excellent they are willing to help you with everything from restaurant reservations to bus tickets the location is excellent and you can pick up tour buses from time square trains to all over new york and is withing walking distance of central park and rockefeller centre the rooms are quite colonial and very comfortable and clean the free cheese and wine of an evening is very welcome and a lovely touch overall we had a really enjoyable stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to new york restaurant row on th street between th and th ave has lots of places to eat with a choice of several different cuisines do not pay the extortionate prices for the rides around the park you can pick up a ride in the park for a quarter of the price do not pay for a taxi from or to the airport you can get a bus for at bryant park or nd street port authority we paid for a taxi from newark airport but apparently it is cheaper from jfk or la guardia go to the top of the rock instead of the empire state as you can get an excellent view of the empire state from there,Positive
i chose this hotel for a spring break getaway with my year old daughter based on the reviews on tripadvisor the rooms were small but i knew that going in the casablanca had everythingfree internet great breakfast great location very clean rooms wonderful staffespecially vanessa at the front desk and the wonderful young ladies who worked in ricks cafe i will be recommending this hotel to all my friends who are visiting new york,Positive
we chose casablanca for our anniversary trip to new york because it is our favourite film however we were delighted to find that this hotel also lives up to its many excellent reviews and indeed exceeded our expectationsapart from the great location just off times square though providing an oasis of calm we found the room and bathroom comfortable and spotless the staff efficient helpful and charming and ricks cafe a real bonus with its breakfast buffet drinks and cookies and evening wine and cheesethe casablanca made our first trip to new york really special and we cant wait to return,Positive
i have just returned from a leisure trip to new york city with two girlfriends and wanted to share our experience in staying at the casablanca hotel it was wonderful location is the best right on times square one block from a main subway station wonderful restaurants etc the staff was superb always friendly and helpful going that extra mile to make our stay memorable entire hotel is tastefully decorated and kept very clean one of the most pleasant extras is the lounge area they provide with breakfast every morning cheese and wine in the evenings and the area is just a pleasant place to go sit and relax we loved it and when i go back to new york this will be the first place i check for accomodations,Positive
this is the best hotel i have ever stayed in hands down i do not say that lightly eithermy husband monthold and i arrived late one night looking like something the cats dragged in we were soaked after our block walk through the chilly rain after an extremely long day of traveling all the way from az with a toddler no less the staff member working the front desk checked us in rapidlywhat really tested their staff and allowed them to shine was the fact that our daughter vomited all over the room that same night after having eaten something we didnt realize had egg in it she is allergic we felt horrible that this had happened but they responded immediately new towels and blankets were brought in and stinky towels and sheets went out remember it was around pm by this time the next morning i asked if someone could steamclean the carpet i figured it would take a while but they told me someone would be there immediately sure enoughall throughout our night stay the staff greeted us with warm smiles and wanted to check up on our daughters wellbeing ive never stayed at a hotel and ive stayed at many who could care less how we are doing any time we requested anything at all they responded immediatelyeven without such an amazing staff the hotel itself stands on its own as beautiful cozy and conveniently located to countless nyc attractionswe loved partaking in the daily continental breakfast in the cozy spacious ndfloor lobby best continental breakfast ive seen at a hotel with lots of yummy pastries cereals fresh fruit juice coffee hot chocolate bagels even hardboiled eggsunlike all hotels weve stayed in there was virtually no wait ever for using the highspeed internet computer and printer super convenient when you need to look upprint directions somewherethis hotel is clearly not a quotfamilyquot hotel per se but nonetheless we felt really welcome there with our toddler nobody made us feel like we were imposing on the hotels vibe by bringing in a small child instead they seemed to view it as a special treat to the hotels community feeldid i remember to say that the hotel was pristinei would recommend this hotel to anyone in a heartbeat,Positive
first impressions on arrival after a long flight were very favourable friendly reception staff and the news that we had been given a free upgrade to a king sized room bed very comfortable room well decorated after an extensive facelift at the end of and spotlessly clean with a good sized bathroom and batha simple buffet style continental breakfast was provided with plenty of variety each evening a complimentary wine and cheese counter including tea and coffee was laid out between and and newspapers were providedthe overall decor had a very individual north africa feel and the furnishings were to a very high standardthe casablanca is on rd west street just off times square which is very convenient for all the sights of mid manhattan the subway is close by my only piece of advice would be to ask for a room at the side or back of the hotel as we could hear the occasional wail of police cars sirens during the night our room was at the nearest corner to times square on the th floor,Positive
we were looking for a small hotel to for our trip to new york with our granddaughter to celebrate her tenth birthday the casablanca was just the right place the fact that is was small and had lots of atmosphere to the balloons in the room for her plus milk and cookies at her beckon call we could not have ask for more the staff was delightful and ricks place for breakfast all of her favorites and wine and cheese my favorite made it perfect we enjoyed our stay and will return in the future for sure,Positive
this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in in terms of staff professionalism overall service and the added little extras that made our time in nyc one to remember its locaton to time square makes it ideal as a base for exploring nyc and once inside its doors you would never think you were so close to such a busy placeit was so quiet and relaxinga definate for anyone looking to get the best out of a visit to nyc,Positive
the room i stayed in was clean small but spacious enough for me and quiet i slept in one day after a late night and the place remained quiet until am when i go up the closet was large nearly walkin i used the iron and board both fine the shower was good good pressure decent soap hot water firm good mattress good pillows both firm and feather provided two of each and an extra in the closetwireless internet is free as it should be never pay for internet access but a little slowservice was great the front desk was helpful and friendly the maids were very goodthe location is probably great for tourists really right on times square i was there on business and no interested in times square however the location worked for me because so many subway lines converge at times square it made getting around the city easyi did not try the included breakfast so cannot comment on thatrates are quite reasonable compared to the other similar boutique hotels that i stay in for business trips,Positive
we planned a getaway trip to nyc for a broadway show and exploring the city location was important but we also wanted a place where we could take a break relax and recharge during the day casablanca fit the bill to a quottquot and more just off time square we could access the subway system walk to a show and still be back in the hotel and enjoy ricks cafe nd floor lounge with comfortable seating coffee tea and cookies as well as breakfast and afternoon wine and cheese between excursions the staff couldnt have been more helpful and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable we now have our nyc hotel for future stays and hope to take family there next year,Positive
a beautiful hotel with excellent service and amenities this will be our hotel whenever our travels take us to new york everyone who worked at the casablanca was helpful friendly and efficient,Positive
we just returned from an excellent stay at the casablanca the service was amazing the rooms beautiful and quiet and we loved ricks cafe at any time you can get iced tea capuchinno expresso etc the breakfast was very nice croissants with cheese and ham in it bagels muffins fresh fruit yogurt cereal and more there was wine and cheese and a vegetable tray in the early evening and cookies and milk at night there was a computer with a printer and internet access they will suggest wonderful restaurants and make reservations for you i loved the tile in the bathroom the woodwork throughout the hotel and classy accent pieces you can check out dvds to watch in the room new york movies broadway show movies and of course casablanca the only slight complaint was that there wasnt a dresser for clothes but there were enough other drawers to put our clothes in,Positive
i have now stayed at the casablanca in summer and winter alone and with family for business and leisure trips and yes i have every intention of going backtwo main things draw me back the atmosphere and the location i am aware that the rooms are not gigantic but i dont spend a lot of time in the room when in in nyc even when i stayed alone for a week on a business trip with a lot of late nights on the laptop in my room to match the australian work hours i didnt find the room size restrictive but i did find that the friendliness of staff and other guests at breakfast and over evening drinks in ricks cafe wonderful the concept of ricks cafe is the cornerstone of the attraction of the hotel fruit pastries coffee and cold water are available all day and night perfect for grabbing a quick snack between meetings or tourist highlights in the morning the breakfast is fresh and plentiful and in the evenings the drinks and snacks are a great pretheatre treat people are friendly and chatty but its also easy to sit alone and read if thats your preferenceregarding location i find it easy to walk almost anywhere from times sq and the subway is right across the road if needed i cant say i enjoy how thick the times sq crowds get in midsummer but its easy to walk up rd to a less congested street to walk along and if youre a theatre nut like me being a minute walk tohome from the theatre and from the tkts booth is simply perfectissues the only problem i have ever had was one room facing the front street was a bit noisy for a light sleeper like me my daughter slept fine it was just me i could have resorted to ear plugs but when i spoke to the front desk they had moved us into a rear room in less than minutes problem solved,Positive
we stayed at the casablance hotel to celebrate my wifes th so we booked a junior suite first impression from the outside was oh no as it does not look very grand however we were welcomed by the doorman and receptionist in turn both very polite and inside it all looks very nice especially the loungeour room was ready so we were taken to the suite on the th floor overlooking the roadthey put a complimentary bottle of fizz which was a nice touch the room was spacious clean and had everything you could wantnow the first moan the web site states the rooms are sound proofed this turned out not to be the case as all night long we could hear the noise of the trucks pulling up at the building over the road a mixture of reversing signals trucks starting their engines and the odd police siren was enough for a disturbed sleep but when we complained they moved us to a quotbetterquot room a twin bedded junior suite at the back of the hotel this was more money but they did not charge us the extra this room was also noisy as you could hear the extractor fans humming all the time but as it was a continuous hum we did get some sleepin the morning there was continental breakfast and in the evening complimentary cheese and wine at all other times cookies and cakes and beverages in the loungethe hotel is yards from times square so is great as a base and wow time square is amazing at night there are so many places to eat drink in the road by the hotel youi dont have to stray far all high standard but with the current exchange rate was a little more than expected but hey this was a once in a lifetime tripcouple of down sides the hotel boasts free wireless but on the th amp th floors the signal is very weak also the tv signal is also poor including when watching a dvd when we were tired out from all the walking in nyctaxi from jfk is and to newark it was yellow cabs dont go there for some reasonoverall this was a pleasant stay everyone was helpful and friendly the hotel is immaculately clean and even the cleaners checked that we didnt need anything as per the title after a very hard days around ny it was a relaxing calm atmosphere in the hotel but boy does it change ouside,Positive
we had read the reviews beforehand so i was prepared for the tiny rooms we had our two boys with us and they slept on the pullout couch not sure why some people said they had to move the coffee table to the other room we were able to push it against the wall easily but yes the rooms are very tiny but with of us we managed fine and also be prepared for the outside noise as well there is no real soundproofing so if you are sensitive to noise while you sleep this might not be the best choice although the front desk was happy to supply us with ear plugs those were the only two real negatives about this hotel and like i said i had read the reviews so we were prepared for those the staff was amazing and very accommodating they were able to find us great seats to see wicked on just a few hours notice were helpful in finding restaurants in the area and just seemed glad to be able to assist us in any way the rooms were clean and the housekeeping was very efficient all in all a wonderful experience and you cannot beat the location just steps away from times square and we were able to walk to many other tourist locations as well,Positive
i found this hotel after reading about it on national geographic i was going to stay somewhere cheaper but decided to splurge for our anniversary the hotel is very well positioned steps from time square for walking or taking the subway the breakfast is great fresh fruit salad yoghourt bagels croissants danish pastries hardboiled eggs fresh fruit fresh juices coffee tea espresso cappuccino cafe latte etc the fresh fruit and hot drinks are available all day the wine and cheese in the evening is also very good there is a computer and printer available and highspeed internet in the bedrooms the staff are really friendly and helpful i would definitely recommend this hotel,Positive
we arrived at am and our room was already ready for us everything was perfect we took advantage of the wine and cheese both days of our stay it was so great to relax after a full day and plan the evening in such a friendly environment breakfast was excellant as well we will be back,Positive
i just returned from a four night stay at the casablanca with my teenage daughter the casablanca lived up to all of the great things said about it on trip advisor which in all honesty i was a little bit skeptical that it was possible after our visit last week i wouldnt even consider staying anywhere else on a return trip to be able to step inside immediately from the hustle and bustle of times square head upstairs for tea and cookies in ricks cafe while enjoying the big screen and then retire for an uninterrupted nights sleep in our quiet and comfortable hotel room was fantastic our bathroom had beautiful tile work and included a high shower head for tall guests with plenty of powerful hot water pressure what amazed me each night was how incredibly quiet our room was room there was no street noise nor one single sound from nearby guest rooms we kept our bathroom window cracked a couple of inches each night and even then were never awakened not even an occasional siren awoke us being from the northwest we easily satisfied our caffeine habit each morning by walking around the corner literally steps to the starbucks at broadway amp rd for a latte then returned to a wonderful breakfast in ricks cafe no offense to the coffee in ricks everyone on staff was extremely friendly and accommodating from the bell staff to the front desk to the hostesses in ricks cafe the casablanca has done a superb job of encouraging exemplary customer service among its employees we were literally greeted by name as we came and went we were sad to leave nyc wishing for one more day or two and the casablanca hotel is a big reason why it truly wrapped our visit inside a very pleasant experience,Positive
this is a good clean hotel at a good price for times square one big plus i didnt see referenced here was that it is adjacent to a parking garage that charges guests only bucks for hours a stunning bargain in this location im giving four instead of five stars only because i didnt think it was a quotfive starquot place in terms of luxury but for the combination of service cleanliness and value i doubt theres a better choice in times square my one nights stay was not as quiet as others have reported but i am an exceptionally light sleeper and didnt expect utter silence in this location anyway note that there was street noise but no noise from neighboring rooms the service lived up to its tripadvisor reputation very professional respectful and responsive in my particular room the quotmoroccanquot theme such as it was amounted to wicker furniture and moorish patterns in the window dressing if youve stayed in the ownership groups other places eg library hotel giraffe the level of comfort quality and customer service will be familiar,Positive
excellent location just off times square and suprisingly quiet and peaceful inside the hotel which made for a good nights sleep the hotel is a non smoking hotel which was great as neither the communal areas nor bedrooms smelled of stale smoke the room was a good size we booked a king bedded room which was a plus as lots of new york hotel rooms are tiny the room had a moroccan theme and was well maintained the bed was very comfortable a mini bar is provided but as with all hotels we didnt use it as it was expensive complimentary bottled water and a bar of belgian chocolate was provided and replenished once consumed the only negative was the room temperature it was fairly cold and the thermostat on the wall didnt seem to work we reported this to reception on our way out for the evening when we returned the heating was working and the room was warm the only problem was that we could not adjust it turn it off using the thermostat on the wall we did not bother to speak to reception about this as it was fairly cold for the duration of our stay so we mostly wanted the heating on we were able to open the windows so used this to cool down the room when needed bathroom nice decor well maintained nice complimentary toiletries powerful shower only downside was the bath tub was small staff everyone from the maid to the reception staff smiled and said good morning in a genuine friendly manner the reception and ricks cafe staff were very welcoming and very helpful last trip to new york we stayed in the grand hyatt which was nice but very impersonal in comparison to the casablanca ricks cafe very relaxing place to chill out and take a break from the crazybusy streets of new york its a complementary cafe for guests which served continental breakfast wines and nibbles between pm and teascoffeees and cookies all day the breakfast was of a good standard easily comparable to the continental selections available in the large star chain hotels i was pleasantly surprised to find a good selection of twinnings teas black green peppermint and variety of fruit teas available there was also a computer provided for guests to use which was useful for checking out museum opening times etc i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definately stay here again,Positive
just got back from a fantastic five night stay at this hotel we booked it based on the hotels location and the strength of the reviews on this website and werent at all disappointedthe hotel manages to remain quiet and peaceful despite the central location just off times square the rooms are fairly small but spotlessly clean and very comfortable the hotel staff are great very friendly and nothing is too much trouble we really enjoyed the cheese and wine each night a relaxing way to start your evening before going outthe hotel is only a short walk away from the hells kitchen area there is a great selection of restaurants along th avenue much better value than eating around times squareall in all a brilliant hotel in a great location would definitely stay there again,Positive
being an avid user of tripadvisor i found this hotel for a last minute trip to nyc for my wifes birthday the hotel was very centrally located to everything in times square as well as the subways as noted in many other reviews when you stay at casablance you do not even relaize you are in the city the hotel is very clean and the quotextrasquot like breakfast and the wine reception are excellent and very much distinguish the hotel from many others i would highly recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone who wants a very nice classy hotel that will go the extra mile before during and after your stay we will certainly be going back,Positive
my girlfriend and i spent three days at this hotel at the end of march originally was going to book the comfort inn since it was more in our price range and had decent ratings on tripadvisor then stumbled on the casablance reviews looked up the site and fell in love with the hotel we got a great rate direct to the hotel over the phone and decided to spend a little extra thank god the hotel did not disappoint in any way steps to times square small amp personal great customer service super clean comfy bedding great shower nice relaxing lounge ricks cafe open hr for energizing the batteries and having a morning meal or early evening snack all free even the toiletries they use are really good although we initially said all we wanted was a clean place to lay our heads at night we quickly realized that this hotel actually made our experience in the city so much better would stay there again in a heartbeat thanks vanessa and al this hotel is lucky to have you keep up the good work i am sending anyone who will listen your way,Positive
the only reason i went to casablanca was due to the trip advisors reviews im from queens and had a getaway weekendto see a play and simply stay overnightthe rates were goodand the room was very nice wine and cheese and other snacks are simply great the breakfast was very good also good location i must have passed this hotel several timesnever noticed it the inside is very cozy and quaint no kidsis a plusalsofor quiet time very friendly staff,Positive
my daughter and i spent three nights at the casablanca over her spring break we had a wonderful time the hotel is literally steps from times quare the staff is super and the amenities fantastic breakfast and the wine and cheese evening reception really make the visit special i would definitely stay there on my next visit to nyc thanks for all the reviews here on trip advisor that helped me make my decision ann k houston,Positive
believe the hype about this hotel its truemy wife and i stayed here st patricks day night after attending a concert in the city this hotel just amazed me i have never seen a company or organization as dedicated to customer service as this hotel is from the moment that we called to make a reservation you could tell that they value their customersthe hotel is about feet away from the nasdaq sign in times square and about a minute walk from the subway station we could watch the jumbotron in times square from our room the hotels parking is next door and is reasonable for midtown new york per day with a validation stamp from the hotel versus if i did not have the validationthe rooms are small that is the only thing bad that i can say about the hotel however they are immaculate and have been soundproofed so you dont hear that much of the noise from times square the hotel is decorated in a moroccan theme which my wife loved she also loved the happy hour wine and cheese i really wish that people who run other hotels would stay here just for one night to see how things are done they could learn a lot,Positive
stayed here based on tripadviser review and not dissapointed spend nights here rooms very comfortable and staff went out of their way to help from the minute we walked in the door complimentary breakfast and wine and cheese in the evening gave and free wireless internet fantastic would definately recommend this hotel for those visting new york,Positive
my girlfriend and i are from queens and we decided to do a night in the city thanks to trip advisor we found this place im going to keep it brief because of the great rating its pretty obvious how great this place isfirst of all its cheap compared to anything around it the location is perfect its in the building next to the nasdaq stock building right in times square everything you want to see is around it the staff is great we had tons of friendly people who were more than happy to take pictures of us or to help with the heat in the room there is the free continental breakfast and the free wine and cheese which is a great starter to a night now the rooms are small but its new york our room was nice but its everything else about the hotel that makes it great hotel,Positive
from stepping into reception after a long flight from the uk the casablanca staff made us feel welcome our room was a small suite on the fifth floor and although the hotel was only seconds away from the hustle and bustle of times square we could have been on a desert island it was so quiet ricks cafe on the nd floor offers an endless supply of tea and coffee and enough pastries to put on a few pounds during your stay this is where breakfast is served with once again enough to satisfy most the gem is the nightly cheese and wine offered by the hotel and served with a smile from hotel team the room was spotless and cleaned every day throughout our stay tonys restaurant right next door offers fantastic and well priced italian food most dishes serve between and people so go there hungry our only disappointment with the casablanca was having to say good bye after a fantastic stay as our flight was not until late evening the hotel were more than happy for us to chill out in ricks cafe after checking out until it was time to leave for the airport would we go back yes would we tell our friends without a doubt,Positive
we just returned from nights in new york city staying at the casablanca on recommendations from tripadvisor i was not disappointed its a lovely hotel reasonably priced for its location we paid a little under a night for a single room with king bed on the top floor times square is literally half a block out the door but somehow the casablanca seems like a quiet little boutique hotel anyway sandwiched between a couple of restaurants the front entrance is literally a doorway the staff is mostly friendly the decor is pretty cool based on the movie casablanca and the little details are well thought out downsides are relatively minor but need to be mentioned wifi is free throughout but was touchandgo in our room the only windows we had looked out the back onto fire escapes and the backs of other buildings from what ive heard thats preferable to a streetside room which can be noisy room was small and too hot elevator was tiny and slow no coffee maker in the room no bathroom heater even in a hot room one likes a little extra heat coming out of the shower no business center just one slow computer in the corner of the breakfast roomthe upside too many to mention free breakfast theres an espressocoffee machine in the breakfast room but the espresso that it makes is pretty lousy so stick to the quitegood drip coffee is hearty rooms are very very clean beds are comfy and have soft sheets and real blankets not those plastic blankets you get in chain hotels service was great i requested a small fan ahead of time and it was in the room when i got there location of course is ideal we were able to walk to a broadway play walk to central park walk to rockefeller center etc etc etc in short i highly recommend the casablanca,Positive
what a great experience at the casablanca hotel we have found a very friendly welcoming comfortable an quiet place to stay in new yorkwe came to visit the artexpo new york at the jacob k javits convention center it was only a few block away walking and on top of all its right on the spot of time square thanks for making our staying so nicejosee gauthier artist from quebec,Positive
i have stayed in nyc before so my expectations are reasonable for a hotel room in this price range i was very pleasantly surprised the room was nicely decorated incredibly clean and surprisingly roomy for a nyc hotel room in this price range it was a short walk from ny penn station but its also close to some subway stations i have already recommended it to a couple friends and i will definitely stay here again,Positive
we just returned from a two night stay and have determined we will definitely stay again the amenities this hotel offers free of charge are unbeatable the hotel is small rooms so guests can easily take the stairs to the lobby and nd floor gathering room no waiting on the elevator the hotel provides complimentary breakfast and in the evening complimentary wine and cheese from pm there is free wifi however the signal is a bit weak at least on the floor th where we stayed free guests passes to a nearby health club are provided the rooms are clean comfortable nice bathroom great hotel staff the location is excellent so if you are sick of the large hotel chains with hundreds of rooms where everything is a surcharge the casablanca is the answer what a find in the heart of time square,Positive
our latest trip here simply superb complimentary champagne for celebrating hubbies th birthday calming and relaxing after the buzz of a great city experience generous welcome genuinely friendly and attentive staff excellent breakfast with top quality products useful complimentary hour selection of refreshments handy for those with jetlag comfortable lounge for relaxing over a book newspaper evening complimentary prosecco or wines cheese and nibbles occasional pianist delightful addition to the ambience we shall most definitely return,Positive
should i get to go back to new york i wouldnt want to stay anyplace else i have no suggestions for improvement on their part perfect,Positive
love this charming little hotel have stayed many times and will definitely go back,Positive
thanks to tripadvisor i found this gem of a hotel for a birthday trip for my husband last week the location is perfect it is literally steps to where the ball drops on new years eve the staff was wonderful we were greeted at our car the minute we pulled up to check in hearing that new york city hotel rooms are quite small we chose to upgrade to the premium king room and it was huge im sure the next step down would have been plenty of space for us the evening reception was amazing there was a great spread of food with white and red wine as well as champagne its a lovely place to relax for a while and we even got to meet other travelers there it feels much more like an inn than a hotel i could hear some street noise the first night in the room but i was exhausted the last two nights so i wasnt bothered at all and i am a really light sleeper having access to free snacks coffee and drinks all day really is a nice touch this is the perfect nyc hotel and i would recommend it to anyone,Positive
my boyfriend and i have just returned from a night stay at the casablanca and i cannot rate this hotel highly enough the service was outstanding throughout and you always felt that the staff were there to help no matter what time in the day when we arrived we were greeted at the car door by someone to help with our bags and checkin was very efficient vanessa was very helpful in helping us get our bearings on the first day and we were amazed to find out that the majority of things on our itinery were in walking distance of the hotelwe reserved a deluxe queen room which was a good size by new york standards and perfect for our needs i would say the room was on a par with other similar star hotels i have stayed in in london i had requested a quiet room on the booking as i knew it was bound to be noisy and our request was granted with no problems reviewers who complain of the noise need to realise they are in times square in new york city what do they expect our only slight very minor issue was the heat in the room it was very warm which meant we had to have the fanair con unit on most of the time we mentioned this to the manager on checking out and he said this was something they were aiming to remedy great stuffanyway the rooms are not what makes this hotel stands out it is the staff and the fantastic ricks cafe which is truly a haven as the hotel describes the hotel is literally steps away from times square but being able to come back here and relax with a drink and a snack at any time of the day is truly a luxury the breakfast was very good and healthy and saved so much time and money on having to eat elsewhere the wine and cheese reception was also fantastic with a lovely selection of cheese crackers fruit and vegetables the whole feel of the hotel is very homely quiet and peaceful the complete opposite of for example the marriot marquis because the hotel is so small they can concentrate on individuals and attention to detail which is great the chocolate placed in the room each night was also a lovely touchwe had a late flight back to london and we were treat as guests long after we had checked out still able to use ricks cafe and the other facilities hassan spelling sorry was very helpful in getting us a cab to the airport we will definitely be staying at this hotel again hopefully in october we loved our trip to new york and this hotel was a big part of that thank you to everyone for making our trip so special,Positive
booked by emailing the hotel direct good idea to try this better rate than the marriott on times square sheraton hilton all on the square areado not use the airport shuttle air link as shown on the hotel web page not good we cancelled the return trip they are that bad morning reception staff very good on the ball evening reception staff could learn from morning staff on the desk suitcases came straight to the room the two room suite over looks rd street you will need ear plugs in these rooms facing this road the hotel knows this and do have earplugs but there is no mention of this on their web pages very large king bed mattress you can feel all the springs an is not comfy brought this to the attention of the morning front desk who seemed to know this already sad its not been dealt with bath room small and compact but very clean the tub is a tub not a full bathnighttime turn down hit and miss st night none nd night had to have the front desk send up water and bath amenities rd night had to ask the evening staff again for the room to have the turn down done for a hotel that prides its self with services the evening team let the side downwifi in the room th floor do not try to use an itouch or a note book there is no reception at all you will have to use the hard line again the front desk new of the problem so really dont think this should be advertised on the www pagesnever had to wait for lifts breakfast simple foods as per the www sitenever heard any other room noise but there is a fire station down the road which like to make a noise late at nighthaving stayed all over the world this hotel is not a dubai beach hotel or a large ny chain hotel or a hong kong hotel it is though a quite well run with some hic ups on the evening shift small hotel in the centre of the hour city of new york times square and is quite frankly very good once they sort out the evening staff and put soft comfy mattress on the beds it will be v very good go and try but dont tell to many people as youll want to go back and there want be any rooms lol,Positive
we stayed nights mid february in family with our years old kid at casablanca hotel double beds room the choice of the hotel was initially made based on the good ranking on tripadvisor and its great location on time square the information given on the internet site further reinforced our opinionthe casablanca is a human size hotel floors building so we avoid long waiting for the lift with nicely decorated clean and well furnishedequipped rooms a particular good point for the high quality bedsall the hotel staff was really friendly with some particular attention for our son service was warm and good typically because of early arrival we could checkin hours ahead of time without problem well by luck our room was ready no problem as well to leave our luggage at the reception the last daywe enjoyed the complementary breakfast with various breads and bagels fruits and the complementary so called wineandcheese reception starting at pm the latter service choice of red white or sparkling wine various sorts of cheese dip and vegetables pop corn is a real plus offered by the hotel it was for sure greater than our initial expectations note that in the same room coffee icetea cookies fruits are available all the time the wineandcheese was a pleasant break highly appreciated after a long day of visitingwalking in the city and before going out for dinner andor further visitingshoppingin summary we really enjoyed this hotel for its location its atmosphere the friendly staff but as well for we have to admit the complementary breakfast and the wineandcheese reception for the prize we paid in february the casablanca hotel was definitely a good deal sorry that because of full booking of the hotel we could not stay there the more nights of our travel in ny,Positive
great hotel we were phoned a few days before our trip to make sure they had our reservation correct nice touch when we arrived our greeting was friendly the staff were efficient very nice and extremely helpful the location is the star couldnt be in a better place the facilities are very well kept up clear and had everything we neededthe lounge was great nice breakfast spread coffee and treats throughout the day and the daily happy hour was great although there is so much to do in the city i only stopped in once briefly great having a comfortable lounge area with newspapers and tv to sit in and catch up on the world when you have a few minutes the computer in the lounge was very handy and the wifi in my room made it easy to keep in touch tooconsidering this is new york the rates were great a real value i have already recommended this hotel to friends and i will definitely stay here again i was on a holiday with my teenage son and the hotel and area had so much to offer for both of us again the location cant be beat,Positive
i booked five nightsl for my parters th and from the moment we arrived the staff where perfect the hotel is small and very homely and very central so easy to return back after sight seeing and they have refreshments and pastries which where always available including cheese and wine on a evening the hotel is yards from times square we ate next door it was so so the best place to eat is carmines which is minutes from the hotel it was recomended by a passing new yorker the people are very friendly sometimes i thought they where talking to someone behind me but i got used to it we used the train to travel as the tourist buses was very expensive i would give thenatural history mueseum a miss as it was average my only regret is dont fly delta airways service quite poor go british airways also remember that the hotel has a local tax charge which works out about per night on top of room charge if your booking a limosine ask the airport jfk for prices they will ask companies to bid for your buisness and you pick the best loved newyork would go back anytime it was a dream holiday,Positive
the location staff service and food were unbeatable from the wonderful breakfast to the cheese and wine between and we cannot enthuse enough about the casablancathe hotel was warm and welcoming with charm and character thrown in we checked out but the hotel looked after our bags as we werent due to fly until the evening on collecting the bags they still invited us up to the wine and nibbles for a last drink before departing now that is what i call service,Positive
we came to the city for a girls weekend and could not have stayed at a nicer hotel the location and service was wonderful we also really enjoyed the complimentary lounge on the second floor that had a computer fireplace and snacks all day long there was always someone readily available to help us in any way the rooms were small but very nicely equipped we will definitely stay there again,Positive
what can i say if you want impeccable customer service a clean quite room and complimentary breakfast and evening cocktail right on time square this is your place we were pleasantly surprised before we even stepped into the hotel they called to confirm my reservation and ask if they could assist making any arrangements when we arrived they were right there to assist with the door and bags there was always a gentleman in the lobby to hail you a cab while there a light bulb burnt our and they fixed it immediately they room was nice and immaculate the pillows were great and the slippers and robes were a nice touch parking next door was very convenient the complementary wine and cheese in the evening and the breakfast in the am were nice it was also great to have the gentleman playing the piano he was also a wealth of information and provided a lot of history on ny city this hotel was literally steps away from time square yet in the hotel and our room we heard nothing it was so quiet i highly recommend,Positive
my husband and i had a top notch experience at the casablanca hotel over valentines weekend the staff was extremely friendly and courteous our rooms were kept perfectly in order and stocked with fresh linens and our favorite part was the lovely daily reception at ricks on the second floor good wine yummy cheese selection and even a great pianist which really set the mood before our date out on the town it was worth every penny and we cant wait to return,Positive
ive been seeing this hotels great reviews for a long time and like many travelers assumed that things couldnt really be that satisfying there i get to new york a few times a year and have experienced several different hotels including several that qualifyy as upmarket and various locations by now always looking for an attractive combination of quality and value most of the time when ive checked rates the casablance was unfortunately higher than i wanted to spend and invariably higher for a room than a suite at some other properties but when my partner and i were heading up from baltimore for a onenight midweek stay this month i decided to investigate the casablanca again the price this time was within or so of other places that ive liked so this seemed like an ideal opportunity to find out what all the fuss was about for us the right attitude at a hotel is nearly as valuable as the ambience and amenities with all the praise these guy get i could imagine the casablanca staff getting terribly snooty but there wasnt a trace of that from anyone that we encountered the feeling was so welcoming from the minute we walked into the lobby that we knew we had made the right choice that feeling never changed i might have missed the spaciousness of a suite when we got to the room but the extraordinary condition of the place the cleanliness and fine details easily compensated superb bed bath and it really is as quiet as other reviewers say we were in an inside room even in the lounge area youd never know noisy traffic was just outside the whole feeling was oasislike a calm welcoming hotel in the very heart of evercrowded times square the experience loved the breakfast and afternoon snacks was so gratifying that at checkout i booked another stay for a trip i was making later the same month rather than even bother with my usual scroll through quikbook seeking the best price and largest accommodation budgetwilling i can imagine returning to the casablanca many more times in the future,Positive
we just returned from a one night stay at the casablanca and after reading all the wonderful reviews we had high expectationsthe casablanca more than delivered we have stayed at many star hotels in nyc and this small boutique hotel surpassed them allhands downwe booked this hotel since we were only here for one evening and wanted something within walking distance of the town hall theatre the casablanca is steps away we had lunch next door at tonys which i dont believe is affiliated with the hotel but was a fabulous italian restaurantthe staff at the casablanca could not not have been more helpful or courteous we had a small but lovely room that looked out over a courtyard you would never know we were steps from the middle of times squareyou couldnt hear a soundglad we found you casablancawe will highly recommend you and be back,Positive
we loved every minute of our stay at the casablanca we were in room overlooked an internal courtyard above the outside patio area of the hotel which we found amazingly quiet considering the hotel is just off times square and ny is never quiet even with the window open we slept really well the room was not overly large but was spotlessly clean with a very comfortable bed and pillows an iron and ironing board safe and mini bar which we didnt open so cant comment on were in the room free internet access was available in the bedroom which was great as well as in ricks cafethe bathroom was small but attractively decorated and again spotlessly clean the water was always hot the towels really high quality as were the two bath robes in the room plus you got slippersbreakfast was very good good range of delicious muffins bagels rollscroissants danish pastries an excellent fresh fruit salad plus basket of apples bananas oranges fruit juice tea and coffee yoghuts good choice of cereals and hard boiled eggs were also on offertea coffee and biscuits were available all day long in ricks cafe which was a lovely place to relax and recharge the batteries in during the day or unwind from pm with the choice of cheeses with crudite sipping a glass of red white or sparkling wine on offer at that timewhat made our stay that much more enjoyable were the staff all the staff were very friendly and helpful but especially the lovely cheerful ever smiling and welcoming ladies serving breakfast and overseeing the wine and cheese in ricks cafe they couldnt do enough for us and were a real credit to themselves and the hotelwe would go back to the casablanca like a shot given the chance,Positive
several years ago before i was familiar with tripadvisor i found this hotel via a google search under nyc bampbs and booked a room for my wife and her mother to attend the annual westminster dog shop my wife spoke so highly of the hotel and staff that this established an annual pilgrimage to the casablanca and the dog show until this year when my mil was unable to attend we even get christmas cards each year luckily i was able to go and stay at the casablanca for the dog show everything my wife said was true the staff is the best ive encountered in all my travels the room was not spacious but great all the same clean towels twice daily terrycloth bathrobes slippers and evening chocolate the breakfast consisted of various breads amp pastries boiled eggs fruit etc the oclock wine and cheeses are also a delight most of the other guests we met were repeat customers and my wife even recognized several other guests from her previous stays i cant say enough about this little gem that is a half block off times square oh yes the westminster dog show was also a hit and as arnold says quotill be backquotlarry amp kelly,Positive
three of us went on a quick overnight to attend westminster kennel club show at madison square garden using the tripadvisor recommendations we booked a suite at the casablanca we could not have been more satisfied with our accommodations sixthfloor suite with one king bed and pull out sofa clean comfortable wellappointed the staff was incredibly gracious to the point of bringing four buckets of ice for the champagne we were chilling for a gettogether with our friend who was showing her dog at westminster my only regret is that we were not able to spend more time in the lovely secondfloor sitting area everything you read is true complimentary wine and cheese multiple offerings in the morning including fresh fruit hardboiled eggs twinnings teas of all persuasions croissants yogurt you name it we would have liked to have spent two hours with the newspapers and a leisurely breakfast we had no issues with street noise even though we were a stones throw from times square the casablanca is within walking distance to so many things one might want to see in the times squaremadison square garden area a short walk to the corner gets you a cab to anywhere and the subway connection is right there thought we did not use this i think the casablance is perfect for a stay in ny city its central location would allow you to use is as a base for any stay in new york no matter where you might go it is an inviting base station for daily forays for anything you might want to do spend an hour or so with the morning papers and then go for a morning walk or sight see go back for a respite in the sitting are with some tea and fresh fruit get some halfprice tix in times square for a broadway show and return for some wine and cheese before freshening up for dinner all within walking distance this place is a keeper in no small part due to the very responsive staff i cant wait to go back for a longer stay only complaint was weak wifi signal in the room only an issue if you need to do a lot of business in your room there is a computer with internet access in the sitting room however,Positive
stayed with my family over christmas chose the hotel based on good reviews on this site and was not disappointed the hotel is just a few feet away from times square you cannot beat the access the hotel rooms were small but well done staff were very friendly perfect place for a ny visit you are paying for the location,Positive
we had a great experience at the casablanca hotel we were in new york to attend the nyt travel show at the jacob javits center we checked into the hotel early am fully expecting our room not to be ready but is was check in was expeditious and courteous our luggage was delivered to our room within minutes and we were downstairs grabbing a complementary cup of coffee and danish before breakfast closed for the morning perfect our room was clean and attractive and very very quiet the coffee and snack service was perfect for a midday pick me up and the wine and cheese at held us nicely until dinner what we loved most about the casablanca was the staff every time we encountered a staff member at the hotel we were greeted warmly and asked if we needed anything really this hotel has found the antidote to the anonymous experience found at many new york hotelsweve stayed in many many hotels in new york but the staff at the casablanca made this stay special,Positive
we really enjoyed our stay the staff were soooo helpful and friendly our room was clean which is so important to us we had three in our room and we would have appreciated bathrobes and pairs of slippers and a blanket for the sofa bed but other then that it was great to us customer service is everything and they deliver,Positive
i feel reluctant to write a review for this great hotel as i always want to be able to stay thereit is friendly especially if youre travelling alone and the guests are also similarly friendly as a result,Positive
my wife and i stayed here as a part of a business tripanniversary getaway and could not have been happier with the choice first the location is only about a minute walk from grand central station and its literally steps from the heart of times square second upon our arrival we were informed that the hotel had reserved a complimentary bottle of champagne for us to celebrate our anniversary so we just needed to let them know and they would bring it to our room third wine and cheese in the cafe on the weekdays was spectacular great selection of cheese and the ambiance was wonderful perfect way to wind down a long day whether youre working or touring the city fourth free breakfast its not omlettes and such but the pastries bagels coffee cappuccino hard boiled eggs variety of cold cereal and fruit was certainly a great way to start the day fifth the staff was spectacular phillip at the front desk was very friendly and extremely helpful with all of our inquiries phillip recommended haru a sushi restaurant just down the street and the food was so good we went there both nights virgils on the other side of the hotel was also good louder and larger so good for kids with excellent southern cooking sixth the chocolate bar at bedtime was fantastic a whole bar absolutely delicious seventh wifi internet access for free this can run or so per night in other hotels wired internet in the room is free too and wifi throughout the hotel is free although the wireless internet connection was slow so the hard line connection in the room is the best way to go eighth after checkout the hotel took care of our luggage while my wife relaxed in the cafe and toured the city as i finished up with meetings at a nearby building we stayed in a king suite bathroom was very nice room was a touch small square feet but large by nyc standards separate living area from the bedroom was nice so you could watch television andor work at the desk in that room with a double door you could shut to separate the bedroom worst issue other than the slow wifi was that it can be a bit loud with the traffic outside there was construction going on in the building across from us that went until about am and of course its nyc so the trucks and the car horns were a bit loud however on our second night we did find that there was a blackout shade closer to the window so you could close the blackout blind and then the interior blinds and that seemed to help shut out the noise there were some rooms that were interior and may be quieter so you could probably request one of those rooms and find the noise and bright lights it is times square after all to be less or nonexistent all in all though the place was fantastic and i would highly recommend staying here the freebies breakfast wine cheese etc and the staff make this place an excellent value i will stay here again and would highly recommend it to others,Positive
spend end of jan three nights at the casablanca hotel we had just a great experience location is fantastic service is great pricequality is fine what more to say location just meters in rd street from time square is just about the best you can get in new yorkservice is great the staff is friendly always prepared to help the space on the first floor used for breakfast is also available throughout the day which is most convenient if you want to drop in between two shoppinghalf days and is also used for the daily to pm quotfree drinkquot the daily free wine and cheese must be quasi unique in new yorkalthough the hotel is not cheap i believe the pricequality ratio is for all reasons above still fine the only negative is the size of the room and of the bathroom but we didnt experience this as a big problem as we didnt spend much time in the room apart from when sleeping,Positive
we have stayed at the casablanca at least five different times and we just love it the staff is so friendly and helpful we love the location and the size it reminds me of small european hotels having the second floor rooms is wonderful for getting together and meeting people we will be back next year or before,Positive
having seen the hotel website i was looking forward to seeing this hotel sometimes photographs can be deceptive not in this case if anything the ambiance was so much better when having the opportunity to interact with the amazing international staff from the pre visit phone call from the hotel to the last goodbye they made our stay as good as all the other reviews sayit is literally at times square but quiet and restful once you get inside the doors a reprieve from the activity giving us time to regroup and enjoy the amenities before heading out again to enjoy the city our room was adaquate and the bathroom was great cleanlinessabsolutely spotless everywherethe wine and cheese were great the breakfast so nice great scones by the way and everyone seemed to have a relaxed attitude which i attribute to the staff who were just superbi dont think i will ever want to stay elsewhere when in nyc,Positive
casablancas staff gets an a location is great for touristy nyc vacations second floor common room with all daynight long refreshments is a great gathering spot bathrooms are larger than double the cost midtown chain hotels very clean environment the doityourself espresso machine is an added bonus i am a bed snob and the mattress was a bit hard for my preference but the fluffy pillows were as good as any i have had in quotupscalequot nyc hotels,Positive
we stayed at the casablanca hotel from january th to th what intrigued me first was the name of the hotel since my boyfriend is a major humphrey bogart fan and casablanca was one of his best movies i decided it would be interesting to stay at a hotel with a casablanca theme the next time we went to new york that decision was made back in after discovering it on trip advisor we had been to new york in after winning tickets to see saturday night live being taped we won tickets again this year so i remembered the casablanca hotel and booked our reservations as it turned out the theme of the hotel is the least of their wonderful attributeswhen i received an automatic email from them stating that they were looking forward to our arrival and if we required any assistance in arranging transporation show tickets restaurant reservations etc then to contact them i asked them about getting tickets for a certain ny show im not going to mention which one because then everyone would expect it and im sure they cant play that card very often vanessa at the front desk emailed me that she would personally try and get us tickets for the show when i hadnt heard that she had succeeded in getting the tickets prior to us leaving home i figured she was unable to get tickets which was understandable but when we got into our room upon our arrival vanessa called us and told us to meet her in the lobby we had to get to the theatre right away it was the coldest day of the year in ny the day that american airlines flight miraculously landed on the hudson that vanessa walked us to the theatre to get our tickets and see the showvalue as far as value goes there are less expensive hotels in new york but the service and extra attention to details from the staff are priceless our stay in new york would not have been nearly as memorable if not for the staff at casablanca i was surprised by how reasonable their rates were especially when you consider the breakfast which is included plus the all day refreshments available the free internet access in ricks cafe including use of a printer and the wine and cheese from to every night the wine and cheese was fabulous after a long day of shopping and walking around it was a great way to relax and reboot it was a great predinner stopover as well when we got back to the hotel particularly late one evening at we welcomed the ice tea and the pastries in ricks cafe and then there is the locationthe location was perfect right at times square we spent a lot of time at night in times square and it was great just to walk to the hotel when we were finished most people would have to take the subway or taxi back to their hotels tonys restaurant right next door was great as well there were a many nearby stores a huge drug store just down the street virgin records sephora etc within minutesthe rooms were very clean each evening we would be asked if we needed more towels and we would be left with a chocolate bar as well our room wasnt that large we had a queen sized room as there were no suites available when i booked weve had small rooms before in london italy and the last one in new york so it wasnt too distressing the bathroom was large the bathroom had all the necessary extras as well including a sewing kit which i always find useful for future use and nice bath robes perfect for getting into when getting out of the shower the wicker stand beside the sink was perfect for keeping makeup and toiletries ineveryone who worked there went the extra mile to make sure everything was ok with the room whenever we would meet anyone in the halls they would ask if everything was ok the manager john introduced himself to us at ricks cafe one evening and asked us if we were being treated alright by staff and he was very glad to hear that we were as customer service is their top priority and it shows when we came in from outside we were always welcomed by people at the front desk when i was in the lobby one evening there was a group of people there discussing their plans and i was told at the front desk that they were from the downed plane that had landed on the hudson earlier that day the casablanca had taken in as many as they could that evening i thought that was very generous of them but it didnt surprise merestaurants that were recommended by vanessa turned out to be great restaurants she made reservations for us at short notice and we got excellent tableswe were made to feel like we were very special guests at the hotel and it looks like they extend that to every one of their guests by the reviews on tripadvisor ive probably stayed at about different hotels some stars and i would have to say that the service at the casablance was the best of them all we wouldnt think of staying anywhere else in nynext time it wont be so long between trips to new york i just hope that with all the rave reviews about the casablanca on tripadvisor well be able to get rooms when we need them,Positive
what can we say that hasnt been said alreadywe had booked a queen room but were upgraded immediately on arrival to a minisuitethe staff were very friendly and helpful and keen for our stay to be perfect but not overpushywe had a wonderful time in new york and couldnt have picked a better hotel for the money,Positive
we have just come back from very enjoyable days in new york we stayed at this fantasic little hotel just off time square called the casablancafor location it couldnt have been betterthe hotel itself is a small boutique type hotel with a north african flavoured decor hence quotcasablancaquot and it looks to me as though it has only recently been completed the rooms were quite small and the bed also was quite small but what it lacked in size was made up by the comfort and enjoyment of staying therethe atmosphere is relaxed and casual and includes a complementary continental breakfast with real fruit juice fruit cereals etcin the early evening there is complimentary cheese and wine which was very enjoyable after a hard day tramping around new yorkthe staff were excellent being very friendly and attentive without being over the top an example of the service was one evening we decided to watch a dvd but the dvd player didnt work correctly but after informing the main desk it was replaced within minsfor the price this cannot be beaten and was far superior to many of the big star hotels i have stayed in in the past i would recommend this hotel to anyone,Positive
despite being literally just steps from times square the location is not the most outstanding attribute for this hotel rather the service is the front desk staff multitasks one minute bellboy the next waiter and then concierge that actually works well for service though as they remember the details about what guests likeand for those trying to save money the hour coffeeteacookie service available is a big plus especially since it includes or kinds of tea and flavored coffee i expected a regular ol continental breakfast in the morning but was pleased to find really fresh fruit and lowcal yogurt and the afternoon wine amp cheese service was unexpected my husband thinks we saved each per day just in the snacks amp drinks you dont always realize you need to grab,Positive
my wife and i have just got back from our first trip to new york what a fantastic city and the stay at the casablanca just added to the enjoyment from the word go we had friendly staff lovely clean and comfortable room small but believe thats the way it is in ny great breakfasts and complimentary wine and cheese every day in ricks on nd floor great room service and staff all over the hotel who really want to make a difference and cover off your every need and request i would recommend this hotel to anyone great location right next to time square mins walk from central park mins from grand central station and mins from maceys as an example hope to come back real soonthe mcneills scotland uk,Positive
if youre looking for big over priced nickel and dimed everything looks the same kind of hotel then the casablanca is not the place for you if you are looking for a hotel with some personality and character with great service and in a great location then youve found the right place having stayed at the big box hotels in various cities from tokyo to london i wanted something smaller and as mentioned above with a little character i found it with the casablanca i stayed in room with a king size bed room size was ample and very clean bed and pillows were comfy bathroom good size showers were really hot lets talk the amenities and all the extra things that come with room things like free wifi in rooms a variety of great smelling toiletries afternoon cookies and tea breakfast early evening wine cheese and crackers computer with internet access in ricks discount parking a true bargain in itself and lets not forget the staff who were incredibly nice accomadating and professional,Positive
casablanca gave my husband amp me a lovely getaway to see theatre in nyc well probably never stay in a different midtown hotel friendly staff comfy room and welcoming nd fl lounge serving breakfast afternoon winecheese and hr snacks cant be beat offers a great location steps fr times sq with free use of a nearby club for exercise,Positive
the only trouble with telling everyone what a find this is is that hotel casablanca may run out of room for us the staff were friendly polite efficient ricks cafe is exactly what weary manhattan travelers need for breaks during the day and evening the room was warm cozy the bed was like nirvana with its down pillows and comforter and soft smooth sheets the list of surprisefreebies is fun chocolate bar at bedtime not just a tiny mint and what a location there you are in the midst of fabulous zany times square and from the peace of the hotel you would never know it and once more the staff lovely smiling helping i feel like moving in,Positive
stayed at the casablanca for nights in november along with our friends from scotland we loved the location just a few steps and we were in times square hotel staff were very helpful john the hotel manager was always available to give advice great buffet breakfast and complimentary cheese and wine every evening between and pm casablanca will be our first port of call on our next trip to new york the hotel booked our transfers to and from newark airport both journeys were on time perfect not the cheapest of hotels but still worth it would recommend,Positive
i red the review here and had a high expectation let me tell you that the hotel far exceeded my expectation because of the convenience and the warmth of the hotel staff and the neatness of the rooms i especially liked the complementary ed floor refreshments and the internet access and the location of this hotel,Positive
the location is superb the service is exceptional ricks cafe is a gema full continental breakfast and winechampagne treat at was great just to relax in the cafe with fireplace and read and sip coffeetea anytime during the day was heartwarming,Positive
this hidden jewel is one block from times square and within walking distance of many theaters and restaurants one of my favorite italian restaurants tony dinapolis is right next door from the accommodations to the service to the complimentary food and beverages this hotel gets an a from me i feel like i have found a home away from home in the heart of nyc,Positive
i recently stayed at the casablanca and was wonderfully surprised at this little hotel we had no trouble finding the hotel the location is fantastic the hotel staff was very helpful and our rooms were such a nice change from the typical hotel rooms that i have stayed in for years my only negative was the warmth of the room we like cooler rooms and the rooms were too warm for comfort and when we adjusted the thermostat down it didnt make a lot of difference the heat is radiator heat versus central air which is why it is harder to manage the internet connection was great for me and being free always factors into the cost of a hoteli would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit the city,Positive
the rooms were clean homely and small but nevertheless a pretty sizeable when you consider the casablancas proximity to times square we were honeymooning and the staff left a little chocolate on our bed which was very sweet everything you needed was in the bathroom including things that are generally too bulky to pack when you are travelling such as cotton buds and cotton tips which was a nice touch the only thing we would say in terms of room to improve was that the rooms were a little stuffy and we could smell cigarette smoke wafting up from the courtyard which was below our room but what can you do smokers need to smoke somewhere right thank you casablanca,Positive
i stayed at the casablana hotel for nights in january with my family there were of us in a mini suite and it was a little tight but we managed we were at the back of the hotel and there was constant noise from an airconditioning unit over the alley which was annoying but the excellent location made up for it we also had issues with the room being far too hot and the first night we slept with the airconditioning on but it was corrected the next day all the staff were very friendly and helpful and ricks cafe is a haven from the cold and hustle of new york in january the computer access was great for the kids and the hot drinks and wine and cheese made a lovely place to relax after a long day sightseeing i would definitely stay at the casablana again and look forward to it,Positive
this hotel was rather nice though there were several negative points the room was very small and hot wifi access was unstable also i think they should order new towels for bathroom the ones we had seemed very oldpositive things were helpfull staff comfortable bed cozy room good breakfast and wineampcheese reception location is great,Positive
we chose the casablance hotel off the back of the reviews we had read on trip advisor and we were directed to an amazing hotel being our first trip to new york and it coinciding with new years eve we were looking for something that extra special and this hotel superceded what we expected the location of the hotel was fantastic we were part of all the new year celebrations and could have watched the ball drop from our bedroom window the hotels provision of a gala package also contributed to our booking and it didnt dissappoint from the course meal open bar performances form broadway stars to the champagne toast on the rooftop watching the minutes to midnight pass it was comparable to a dream with everything fitted to what we wanted to experience the location in regards to the tourist sites was fantastic too most of them within walking distance but the staff were on hand to assist in any way they could at this point i would like to extend our personal thanks to hassan maria geoffrey and our cleaner anka who with their extra attention to detail made for an excellent stay honestly i can not rave about this hotel enough on any future trips to new york should we be fortunate enough to revisit this awesome city casablance hotel will once again be our base finally i know you cant gaurantee the weather but the snow falling on the city on new years eve was the icing on the cake this holiday was what dreams are made of and a huge chunk of that was down to the casablanca thank you guys so much and hopefully we will see you real soon,Positive
we stayed here from dec to jan the hotel had a great night new years package from the moment we arrived the staff was fabulous and tended to our every need we had everything from chocolates and champagne in our room a great mealentertainment at tony di napolis for new years to a rooftop view of the ball drop for new years eve at which time my boyfrend proposed the staff had been aware of this all along and did everything to make our night special overall it was a wonderful stay the rooms are very clean theres a free wine and cheese in the evenings as well as continental breakfast every morning free wifi etc etc the location of the hotel is fabuous right in times square with all the major tourist attractions within walking distance including broadway empire state central park rockefeller plaza th ave shopping radio city music hall etc etc i do not have one complaint with this hotel i will definately stay at the casablanca again when we go back to nyc hopefully sometime this year,Positive
wonderful hotel small as most hotel rooms are in ny but quaint and very clean the staff bends over backwards make your stay as comfortable as possiblethe beds were pretty comfortable and the breakfast and wine and cheese were a nice feature the hotel is off the beaten path of times square but so close to everythingi would definatley stay here again when traveling to nyi am very picky about where i stay and do my homework before i book anything you will not be disapointede bryantboothwyn pa,Positive
from the moment we arrived the staff were so friendly and more than helpfull the rooms were clean and of a great size the restaurantcafe on the nd floor was simply top quality the location is another plus with time square on your doorstep but most of all the staff in this hotel are the best i have come across in a long time david the manager cant do enough for you thishotel is simply the best in new york,Positive
myself and girlfriend stayed here for nights to celebrate my th birthday upon finding out it was my birthday the hotel sent up a free bottle of champagne the room itself was on the small side but as they say less is more the room was well appointed and was spotless the bed was extremely comfortable and was quiet the staff done everything they could do to be helpful and the free nightly wine and cheese tastings was a really nice thing to come back to after a strenuous day of sightseeing would recommend anyone to stay here a tip we flew tofrom newark we got a taxi from the airport to the hotel it was around after tipthe taxi driver asked for more tip saying it was not enough what i gave him the only thing i hate about the us we got the train back from the hotel it cost each and took minsto get to airport vs the hour to get to hotel in traffic will get the train next time from airport its is stops on nj transit from penn station and is much easier than you may think,Positive
the casablanca is a fantastic hotel probably the best ive ever stayed in great atmosphere a small number of wellfitted rooms and excellent staff make this a relaxing place to stay upon arrival we were informed that the heating in the room was set quite high but if it was too hot then just call downstairs and ask someone to set it for us this we did and the job was done in minutes flat and the room was then comfortable throughout our stay this level of speedy service was the norm during our stay the rooms were wellpresented with very comfortable beds the maids were in to tidy up replace the towels replenish toileteries and make the beds twice a day and the bedding was changed regularly toothe service provided by all the staff at the casablanca was akin to a star hotel before we left the uk we received a courtesy call from the concierge to confirm the booking and to ask if there was anything they could do with us prior to our arrival such as make restaurant reservations for us in our case they arranged a local bakery to make me a birthday cake that was a nice touch while we were there every single styaff member from the maids and waitresses through to the bellmen and desk staff were friendly helpful and immaculately turned out weve never been made to feel more welcome anywhere and the staff genuinely seemed to mean it when they greeted us with welcome home and treat it like your second home ricks cafe provided an absolute oasis it was a breath of fresh air to come back to a movie or even a live pianist and tranquil wine and cheese reception each evening a real contrast from the hustle and bustle of the city streets the complimentary tea with a great selection for those brits who dont like standard american tea coffee and cookies really were available along with iced tea filtered water and other sundriesit was also fantastic to be able to use this great lounge area while we waited for our cab to the airport too it really took a load off to have a base in the city even after wed checked out if i had any criticism it would be that the car service organised by the hotel is a bit expensive we ended up calling our own car service that we saw advertised on tv which was not only dollars cheaper but was really very good the restaurant next door tonys is a nice place with great staff its not actually part of the hotel but is affiliated with it even having a door direct from the lobby into the restaurant the food is good value and tasty but is a little odd in its presentation all meals are sharing platters between two to three people and theres not much in the way of sides most brits will find some things on the menu a tad odd but we still had a nice evening herewell definitely be staying here the next time we visit new york and we feel it really is a home from home,Positive
i couldnt say one bad thing about the casablanca hotel the location was ideal the room was beautiful and the service was exceptional when you walk out the front door of the hotel youre only metres away from the southern end of times square in fact you can take photos of it from the front door of the hotel the casablanca upgraded my mum and i to a kingsize room which was roomy and very comfortable and there was also an elevator to get mum upstairs which was very helpful if youre travelling with someone whos a little older the staff were extremely helpful no matter what time of the night or day you walked through the door and ricks cafe was my little haven we would go there at all hours of the day for a tea or coffee for our afternoon wine and cheese session and it was just a great place to relax and unwind after a long day of walking around nyc breakfast was also lovely i would stay at the casablanca again in a heartbeat thanks to all the staff for making our stay so special,Positive
we spent christmas week at the casablanca and had a good experience our room was quite nicewe splurged on a minisuiteand the staff was lovely only a couple of very minor critiques regarding the room the towels were a bit scratchy there wasnt a lot of storage space in the bathroom for makeup etc neither of the two dvd players nor the cd player worked and when we arrived the temp in our room was around degrees which we quickly remedied by cranking down the thermostat and turning on the ceiling fans otherwise the room was immaculate and nicely decorated and the bed was extremely comfy we loved the lounge with the hour snacks and hot drinksjust what was needed on a cold and windy day after walking around midtown for hours the continental breakfast every morning was nice as well did i mention that the staff was great i cant say enough about them our room faced rd st and there was some street noise the garbage trucks at am were not pleasant but that only happened once but hey its new york and the casablanca is literally feet from times square we were able to walk to and from penn st as well as rockefeller center public library skating in bryant park th ave central park restaurants broadway shows etc we tried tonys italian restaurant next door for dinner on our first night and it was finehuge portions of food at a reasonable price plus great people watching next time we go to nyc we will probably stay in a different area of the city just for variety but if youre planning to be in midtown you cant do any better than the casablanca,Positive
just returned from a day stay at the casablanca and we were thoroughly pleased with our stay there it was just what i wanted from a hotel in new york city during christmas week the weather was cold but the hotel made us feel warm and cozyfrom the gracious staff to the open hours a day relaxing public room it was a treat to be able to sit in the room next to a fire and have hot chocolate tea fruit or cookies at any time i always felt as if it was an intimate bedandbreakfast rather than a hotel i loved the north african inspired decor would have preferred north african music piped into the public areas instead of christmas music my only complaint,Positive
i booked this hotel as a surprise for my husband to celebrate his th birthday and quite frankly i dont think i could possibly have found a better place to stay in new york from start to finish the staff were fantastic i had a conversation with the head housekeeper i think it was maria and it was refreshing to see how much pride she genuinely took in making sure everyone was happy with their stay our room was spacious comfortable and spotlessly clean as was the loungebreakfast areafrom the young ladies who served breakfast and the cheese amp wine in the evenings to the reception and door staff hassan was exceptionally pleasant and ran around for us no end there is simply nothing negative i can say about these peoplewe had an absolutely amazing time in new york and if we are ever lucky enough to return i would not consider staying anywhere other than the casablanca,Positive
the casablanca hotel is a great place to stay even though the address off time squarethe hotel is quiet and safe etci would highly recommend this hotel please read all the other current reviews as the say it all again the hotel is great,Positive
thoroughly enjoyed our first ever trip to nyc and this was in large measure due to the hotel didnt want an anonymous corporate monolith and we certainly didnt get onethe casablanca is perfectly positioned for the major sights wellrun ever so slightly quirky and with very friendly staff who take a personal interest in ones stayloved itthe cheese and wine evenings are a great idea not sure if this is just a novelty to us europeans but a good way of meeting some other guests if you wish or not excellent hospitality,Positive
i was really looking forward to my stay at the casablanca as it was reviewed as the top hotel in new york on trip advisor perhaps i have just been fortunate enough to have stayed in some amazing hotels but this was certainly not one of them the bill for two nights was over more than the flights from london yes the staff were friendly but everything else was decidedly average the wine and cheese reception was disappointing note to the hotel not everyone likes chardonnay the cheese could have at least come from a proper deli not the local supermarket and phili cream cheese in little tubs for breakfast really was quite insulting especially to new yorkers who pride themselves on great bagelsi would save your money and stay somewhere else,Positive
it is the little things that can make a hotel stay good or bad and i have to say that the service is what makes this hotel an excellent choice for staying in nythree of us shared a king suite room and by midwest standards it is small but by ny standards it was spacious there was street noise but this is nyyou arent going to find quietthe little things that will bring me back to this hotel again are the staff and service the complimentary winecheese each evening and the breakfast bar were extremely nice to come back towake up to each dayand a money saver if youve never been to ny these things will cost much more than you ever expect i also appreciated that these things were available all daynot just during certain hours after a long day of being in the city coming back to the lounge was quite nicefinally while most hotels will hold your luggage for you after you check out the hotel staff treated me like i was still checkedin i still had access to the amenities and after traveling to this city before this is not always the casethis is a great stay because of its location to times square broadway public transporation central location etcbut the real reason is the staff and amenities,Positive
we and our friends arrived home yesterday from excellent nights at the casablanca hotel in nyc we booked the hotel following the excellent reviews on trip advisor and were not disappointed from our arrival to our departure everything was just perfect the hotel is literally paces from times square so right in the centre of the action however once in the hotel it is a true oasis of calm and tranquility complimentary hot drinks and pastries are served all day so whatever time you arrive back you can always head to ricks cafe a comfortable lounge area to relax and unwind all staff receptionists doormen hostesses in ricks cafe were just lovely so helpful polite and welcoming reception would always go out of their way to help with table reservations or give general guidance on how to reach a particular sight of interest suggesting which subway to take etc bedrooms were clean tidy and comfortable breakfast consisted of a variety of cereals rolls bagels pastries fruit and hard boiled eggs you could visit as many times as you needed to the cheese amp wine session from pm each night was another enjoyable affair again you could take more than one visit to the counter and we often did we visited new york in and stayed at a different hotel if we ever go back to this bustling exciting and wonderful city and we sincerely hope that we will the casablanca would be our first choice and we would thoroughly recommend it to anyone thinking of giving it a try it was quite wonderful and one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in a good hotel is a fundamental part of any holiday and this little gem made the trip perfect in every way book it today,Positive
recently returned from a night stay at the casablanca extremely helpful staff and a good clean comfortable hotel albeit a little too expensive for what it is,Positive
efficient and friendly service convenient location clean hotel in good state of decor room fairly small no bath just a shower ancient tv took up too much of what little space there was wine amp cheese is a nice touch but very basic breakfast fruit cereal pastries interesting moroccan theme some would say tacky but i thought it was quite funbill including tax came to almost for nights it may be naive of me given the location and the time of year quotholidayquot season but for this price i was expecting something amazing and what we got was just a nice little quirky hotel for that reason i would not return,Positive
i have just returned from a holiday in new york and had to leave my comments on the casablanca this is a wonderful hotel there is absolutely nothing bad that i can saybefore we left for new york we were contacted by the hotel to confirm our reservation and wish us a pleasant trip over which i thought was a nice gesture when we arrived we were upgraded to a king room having booked a standard room the room was immaculate and extremely clean nice touches included bottled water and chocolate robes and a cd and dvd playeryou could borrow new york related dvds from reception the room was also vey quiet considering the location on the location you are a stones throw from times square and all amenities it really is fantasticthe breakfast was great pastries bagels cereal tea coffee juices etc and the st floor lounge was a great place to unwind after a days shoppingespecially with a glass of winefinally i cant thank the hotel manager enough for the way in which he treated myself and my now fiance he helped him to arrange a surprise proposal complete with complimentary champagnei havent met a nicer more professional person and it was a pleasure to deal with himwhat more can i say book the casablanca you will not be disappointed,Positive
great rooms very clean everybody extra friendly we paid for the inclusive package but they where all out of bubbly no big deal for me but some might be upset over that they did have complimentary wine amp chesse reception that was nice we dont go in for a big breakfast so the europeanstyle breakfast was great for us lots of coffee frest fruit bun of some kinds not to bad the rates are like any hotlel they all are a little high but you get a great room a good nights sleep cozy for sure you will leave rested and ready to explore the big apple for thats what staying over night is all about,Positive
this hotel is lovely and clean there are however some points i must make to make this a fair review we had a quiet room at the back of the hotel the ac unit is direct to the outside so some street noise can always be heardwhat you do need to bear in mind though is that this is new york city there will always be background noise the room itself i felt was small as was the shower room what we did miss was a bath after pounding the streets for hours and hours personally we would have liked a relaxing soak but that is very personel preference we cannot however distract from the very personel service that this hotel offers turn down every evening with chocolate bar wine and cheese complimentory pmpm every evening and the very high standard breakfast offered every morning was a real bonusall the staff were extreamly helpful polite and courtious throughout our stay and find it hard to believe that some reveiws have been negative towards staff here we greated everybody in the same way we were greated every time we walked through the doors and never had a discourtious word said i have to say with this hotel its the little extra touches that make your stay very special nothing too extravigant but you are made to feel that little bit more welcome than some big chain hotels this hotel isnt cheap but for the service you receive is worth those couple of hundred more we had a complimentiry bottle of bubbly included in our stay and the front desk made sure we received this all in all i would book to return to this hotel as the location is fantastic and central and the little extras make your stay that little bit more specialtonys italian next door good pasta reasonable prices for pasta and meatballs enough for two be warned the beers are expensive for a corona also spankys bbq just up the street is worth a mention just what youd expect from an american eatery reasonable beer good ribs and chicken and the service and staff very good we loved nyc and will be making a return journey sometime in the future and if the prices at cassablanca stay reasonable will book to stay there againjoanne and martin mcgee west yorkshire,Positive
juat spending a few nights in ny this is the perfect place close to everything very friendly staff good service quality coffee free h wine and cheese in the afternoons for free small rooms but thats refleceted in the very affordable price good breakfastjust perfect for european tourists spending a short vacation in nyclars and rozita sweden,Positive
excellent hotel great service especial thanks to john the maneger,Positive
what a great hotel paces from times squarethey treat you like royaltyeven though its paces from times square the hotel is very quietthe hotel is also very clean and very modernthe breakfast and evening cocktails are awesomei look foward to returning,Positive
the casablanca hotel was an oasis of calm amid the manic streets of manhattanwe really enjoyed our stay at the casablanca most of the previous reviews were spot on the highlights of the hotel have to be the relaxed breakfast hour coffee and cheese and wine evenings all of the staff we met were very cheerful and helpful we didnt try the restaurant next door so we cant comment but the best meal we had was at the trattoria trecolori four blocks up on th street if we come back to new york wed definitely stay here again,Positive
just spent nights at the casablancawhat a hidden gem right on times square but away from the noise and hustle and bustle right from the time we stepped through the door and when we left the staff can not do enough for you we had been given a superior room at the back of the hotel they was no view but it was lovely and quiet the complimentary bathroom amenities a lovely touch breakfast a perfect way to start the day and all day tea and coffee is a great bonus staff are there hrs a day and ready to help and offer advice cheese and wine every night a great way to meet other guests would reccommend heartland chophouse brewery just down the road for nice food steaks burgers fish dishes and assorted beers which my husband said were good all reasonably priced hotel is lovely and clean staff are so friendly and helpful i would recommend the casablanca hotel to anyone wanting a lovely hotel and central location mark and debbie gillen wakefield,Positive
my partner and i recently traveled to nyc to get married we decided on this hotel for our special occasion based on tripadvisor reviews the reviews could not have been more accurate we are absolutely in love with this hotel and nyc the staff at the casablanca could not have done anything more to make us feel welcome and accommodated they went out of their way to make our special day even more special john the general manager was especially fantastic and deserves a special mention as do the great cheese and wine evenings we are so impressed that we have already planned our return in april we would never consider staying anywhere else,Positive
my wife and i are just back from a day trip to new york to celebrate my st birthday which was quotcomplimentedquot by our stay at the casablanca we have nothing bad to say about the hotel and can only reiterate every positive comment you can read in any of the reviews listed every single member of staff was top notch and the hotel itself is absolutely perfect for a stay in new york hats off to the casablanca and all its staff bob amp annmarie snaddon aberdeen scotland,Positive
just returned from the hotel casablanca spent nights at this superb hotel for my daughters st birthday booked this hotel due to the wonderful reviews on trip advisor i must say we were were delighted the staff were exceptional the manager was professional and lovely at all times i am at a loss as to what some people exspect from a hotel as the standard provided at this hotel is second to none it felt like home after a long day shopping and the homely greeting at the front desk was always a lovely touch the breakfast and cheese and wine were so welcome and made a for a much cheaper trip as on nights we were so tired from shopping we filled up on the cheese and wine and its not just cheese and wine there are dips bread and many other things meaning we did not want dinner i have stayed in many high rated hotels my father was in the industry but i can truthfully say this hotel deserves its status the staff work so hard nothing is too much trouble and the quite rooms that are clean and well furnished make the whole experience really special i have previously stayed in some of the bigger hotels in new york and felt like a number not a name,Positive
if i were to write how pleased i was with my trip and in particular the standard of accommodation at the casablanca hotel i could not write enoughmy trip was an indulgence to mark my th birthday and i left my husband and children at home for some girls time with a very close and dear friend from swedenwe were very pleased with first impressions of the hotel and these were buoyed up for the duration of our stay lovely warm clean room big bathroom and good daily maid service we loved the relaxed atmosphere of the day lounge where breakfast and evening drinks were served daily as inclusive the girls who poured our drinks and toasted our bagels were delightful interested in our trip and keen to anticipate our needs we felt like familyin fact this has to be the casablanca trademark high quality service with an individual touch we felt safe and welcomed each time we entered the lobbyour holiday could have been a disaster had we not had such a wonderful place to lay our heads i am so glad that we followed other trip advisor reviews and booked in at the casablanca we will return,Positive
a lifelong friend and i stayed nights at casablanca and will return everyone very helpful especially the doorman whose name is al i believelocation superb at times square but oh so quiet we walked to theatresgreat to get continental breakfast and wine and cheese every day,Positive
my husband and i just returned from our first visit to new york we chose the casablanca based on tripadvisor reviews and we werent disappointed i was a little apprehensive about warnings of noise small rooms and lack of security so i made a call to the hotel and spoke with vanessa she was so incredibly helpful and kind i knew after speaking with her that my concerns werent warranted and that wed have a wonderful staywe arrived early on a monday and though i was expecting to leave our luggage and come back at checkin time our room was ready for us when we got there the staff were friendly and helpful from the moment we walked in the door yes the room was small we stayed in a king room but there was plenty of space for us and our luggage the room and bathroom were immaculately clean which is the most important thing to me in a hotel as far as the noise goes there was barely any at all granted we did stay in a room on the back so we werent facing the busy street but the only sounds we heard were occasional sirens and even that wasnt loud enough to bother us besides what do you expect when youre staying in times squareevery evening when we returned to our room it was spectacularly clean the staff gave a great recommendation for a wonderful little bar nearby jimmys corner the breakfast was filling and delicious wine and cheese in the evening was fabulous the coffee and cookies were greatly appreciated and the people we met at the casablanca were wonderful i cant say enough great things about our stay i recommend this hotel for anyone who wants great service cleanliness and kind people in a nonpretentious atmosphere,Positive
we love this wonderful hotel i found this on the internet four years ago and we stay there every year a group of my girlfriends go to new york for days every year once we found this place there was no going back anywhere else in fact we make our reservations every year when we leave for the next visit vanessa at the front desk is so cheerful and helpful al was always there at the front door he even weighted our luggage for us because we thought our bags were overweight john always had a smile for us and was most helpful with anything we needed the ladies taking care of the breakfast and wine and cheese time were delightful as well always pleasant to talk to and offering extra service when needed the rooms are just what you need when staying in new york city since you dont spend alot of time in your room anyway we refer all of our friends to this hotel you meet the nicest people in this hotel at breakfast and at the wine and cheese time,Positive
my daughter jess and i stayed at this hotel from th to th november to celebrate her th birthday and we both had a great time like others say it is exceptionally quiet considering you are only steps away from times square when we arrived we were met with chocolates and champagne in our room all complimentary they had picked up on the fact it was jesss birthday which made her feel really special i had no issues with any of the staff they were all professional and polite and very helpful if jess was younger this wouldnt be the place i would choose its not geared up for young children but it is ideal for couplesgroups of friendspeople with older families the cheese and wine night and breakfast encourage you to meet new people and get chatting we met some lovely people there hi jerry and mia and the lovely nurse and her lovely friend who so bravely fosters the girlsi would go back again without hesitation and i can be picky,Positive
a welcoming staff greets you when you walk in the door the hotel is very european in size and style ricks cafe is warm and comfortable for breakfast and for a glass of wine after a show or shopping as philadelphians who enjoy broadway thiis hotel will be our new home in nyc the diner next door is perfect for a late night hot pastrami or wonderful bowl of soup the atmosphere is calm and quiet with times square just steps away the casablanca and quotbilly elliottquot made for a wonder ful nyc escape thank you john,Positive
i loved the casablanca i recently got married in new york and stayed at this gorgeous boutique hotel it was a group trip and there was of us in total every single one of my guests commented on how fantastic the casablanca were the staff are so friendly and will help with anything they possibly can the breakfast really sets you up for the day and the staff will get you anything they can the casablanca could not put a foot wrong in our eyes and were fabulous i have to comment about john the manager he was so helpful and i cannot understand the previous persons post he is so helpful and is clearly an educated man he was always attentive to our needs and nothing was too much trouble i know we will be back to new york and i know we will stay at the casablanca again its become our home from home,Positive
we have stayed at hotels all over new york for years two years ago we stopped we stay only at the casa blanca were here times a year and the quality and service are always impeccable the staff is the friendliest staff iquotve ever seen in a new york hotelif youre looking for a home away from home you cant go wrong with the casa blanca not only are the staff friendly and accomodating the ambiance is truly casa blanca the rooms are nice and big by new york standards the common room offers outstanding breakfasts and wine and cheese every day for free small groupings of tables make the spaces cozy and homey some nights they have a jazz pianistweve quit looking for other hotels we stay nowhere but here we love it,Positive
we stayed at the casablanca november through the staying at the casablanca was truly a lovely experience we had read many reviews on tripadvisor and made our decision to stay based on the reviews we were very pleased our room was located in the back of hotel our room was very cozy and quiet my husband and i loved the tranquility of ricks cafe you could leave the hustle and bustle of times square just a few feet away read the paper have a drink or a snack and most of all relax the continental breakfast was excellent and the wait staff very personable and attentive the desk staff and bellman were very helpful with directions and always greeted us on our entrance on our next visit we will certainly stay at the casablancaby the way tony denapolis next door served a terrific meal the brooklyn diner next door also served a delicious after theatre dessert,Positive
very good location i would like to acknowledge phillip the bellman who was such a helpful individual very professional and accurate however i cannot say the same about the front desk employees who could care less about this review management is another joke i had such trouble with the internet in my room i had asked for assistance eventually i had to speak to the gm privately my encounter with the gm seemed to have no effect on my slownot working internet i noticed that his eyes were very glassy and nostrils wide opened his vocabulary was terrible and he showed me no class i was very disgusted when one late morning i was exiting the building and as i was exiting the building the door to the front office was opened and i heard the gm tell another employee that i was another stupid guest who was complaining about the internet and how he didnt care if i had important emails that i had to attend i walked away after i heard that very dissappointed stay away if your on a business trip sister hotels are nothing like this hotel so try to stay at the library if you are around midtown manhattan,Positive
my daughter and i had a great few days staying at the casablanca the hotel is small but personal and the staff couldnt have been more helpful or courteous i would certainly stay here again particularly as the location is so close to times square and therefore very central,Positive
this was our first visit to new york from london and we could not have chosen a better hotel the staff were all knowledgeable friendly and helpful and the room was clean and pleasant with all the facilities we could have wished foralthough the hotel is only paces from times square with all its noise and bustle once inside there is no noise to be heard being so close to times square and the subway meant that it was easy to get around either by walking or by subwayas it is a small hotel we found that both staff and guests were very friendly and it was good to meet up with so many different people both at breakfast which was excellent during the day and in the evening when cheese and wine were served tea coffee biscuits pastries and fruit were available all day which was great as we found that sandwiches from delis were far too large we would thoroughly recommend this hotel both for its location and its ambiance and had a great stay,Positive
we were overwhelmed by the choice when trying to pick a hotel in ny and eventually made our decision based on reviews on the webwe spent nights at this small but lovely hotel and can only confirm all the good things we had read it has a perfect location just off times square and several of the citys attractions can be reached on foot it is the personal touches that make this hotel so special the wonderful helpful staff the great quality breakfast the complimentary wine and cheese free use of the internet etc although the rooms are a little pokey they are clean and nicely furnished i thoroughly recommend it to any tourists visiting the city,Positive
my husband and i spent the day quottouringquot prospective hotels for an upcoming trip to the big apple and wanted to make sure we would be happy with our choice im glad we did we wanted to make sure we would be close to the theater but away from all the hustle and bustle this hotel fit that criteria however the hotel is in serious need of updating the staff was friendly and accommodating but the hotel from the entrance to the tiny elevator and the dated hallways and rooms were anything but upscale from what we were expecting we looked at several hotels in the area and all met or exceeded our expectations i would not recommend this hotel there are many other better choices in the city,Positive
excellent hotel great service good size room and bathroom quiet and yet right at the heart of times square we would absolutely stay there again when visiting nyc,Positive
stayed for one night with my senior mother to celebrate her birthday great location near times square we walked from penn station to the hotel about blocks from hotel to radio city about blocks to restaurant row our room was not available at early checkin so we stored our luggage and enjoyed the fresh coffee tea latte etc and fruitpastries available all day on second floor lounge before heading out into the city for awhile everyone was extremely polite helpful and accommodating rooms and bathrooms appeared updated and very tasteful hotel very clean didnt make it to evening wine and cheese but there was a bottle of champagne in our room when we returned at night loved everything would return in a heartbeat,Positive
this was our second stay at the casablanca and it gets better and better although pricey this small hotel is in a great location just off times square with easy access to local restaurants and theatres as well as a subway stop that takes you to other neighborhood the rooms and bathrooms are good sized by nyc standards the dcor is done in a moroccan theme that works breakfast at ricks caf the lounge on the second floor was always a pleasure as was the wine and cheese event held there every night from and which we always made a point of attending no matter where we were at we had to ask the staff for help at a few points and their response was inevitably friendly and useful,Positive
we stayed in the casablanca hotel for a week in october and really enjoyed our staywe arrived in a rain storm and were a bit apprehensive when we saw the small door of the hotel on the opposite side to a building sitewe need not have worried we were warmly greeted and checked in with no problems and we were assured of a quiet room as we had requestedour room was quiet as promised and it was a reasonable size with plenty of storage space and a safe which we believe every hotel room should have one also the main room light was in the centre of the room and gave good lighting why do the majority of hotel rooms have the lighting at the sides of the room which can make for dark roomsthe bathroom was also a reasonable size and very clean there was a small set of drawers in the bathroom giving ample space for storage of our nickknacks a nice touch there was the usual supply of toiletries the bath towels could have been a bit biggerthe bed linen and towels were changed every day housekeeping even came round in he evening to check if we needed the towels changed another nice touch they also provide a bar of chocolate each evening much better that the measly bits of chocolate provided in some hotelsthe lounge ricks turned out to be the hotels biggest benefit it was a quiet haven in the hustle amp bustle of new york you would not believe you were half a block from times squarefor breakfast there was a choice of fruit salad cereals yoghurt fruit and pastries with plenty of coffee including decaff the food and coffee were replenished promptly the one drawback was that there were only a few tables where you could sit to eat properly the remainder of the seating was easy chairs and sofas fine for the wine and cheese but not the best for eating a bowl of cereal maybe we are getting picky in our old age breakfast time could also be busy so finding any seat was sometimes a problemthe evening wine amp cheese time was one of the best points of the hotel it is an excellent idea and just right to return to several glasses of wine a choice of white red or sparkling and some cheese and biscuits after battling through times square in this case the easy chairs and sofas were just rightfor the rest of the day and evening ricks provided complementary coffee hot chocolate and cookies again just right after returning from the theatrethere is only one pc with internet access in ricks and whilst we had to wait a few times this was not a big issue noone hogged the pc unnecessarilyall the staff were extremely helpful any problems were promptly fixed for example our room was initially too hot the radiator was stuck at high but this was fixed whilst were out the servers in ricks cleared plates away swiftly and made sure the tables were clean the lobby staff were extremely helpful and were full of suggestions on where to go etcall in all an excellent hotel in a marvellous townsome tipsthere is a post office a block and half up rd street just turn left out the hotelthere is an information office close by turn right out of the hotel then right and it is about three blocks down you can buy tickets for the bus tours here and much morefor uk visitors if you are visiting meadowlandsgiants stadium then take your passport if you want a beer they only serve you after producing either your passport or us drivers licence even though i am over sixty and look it i was refused a beereatingtonys right next door excellent italian food the portions can be large although the lunchtime portions are more manageablethe red flame diner th street between th amp th avenues excellent place for good nonpretentious cheap food the soup is excellent just right for a light mealjohns pizzeria th street very good pizza although not as good as santaniellos in bedford uk you can have a variety of toppings on the same pizza excellent to sharejuniors for cheesecake two locations brooklyn flatbush avenue or grand central stationrestaurant row is on th street between th amp th loads of restaurants for almost every conceivable type of food,Positive
i stayed at the casablanca for nights in midoctober i had a room on the third floor and found the room to be extremely quiet in fact i slept better at the casablanca than i did at the other hotels i stayed at in the usa even though the others were in quiet rural locations the room was at the back of the hotel not facing the street and although this makes it a little dark it was probably the best choicethe room was a little on the small side and lacked a bit of draw space for longer stays however the wardrobe is big enough and a table and chair are also provided after a bit of tooing and froing we managed to get settled the owners have resisted the urge to cram lots of furniture in a good thing in my viewthe bathroom was nicely finished and was functional with a full length mirror yay making good use of spacethe standard of dcor was acceptable to goodone thing i would say is that the room was extremely clean when we entered it and i do look at these things and was correctly and properly cleaned and tidied each dayricks caf is a nice place to get a cup of tea or coffee it was about the only place in my trip to the usa where i managed to get a really good cup of tea and my wife liked the choices of different types of coffee breakfast was ok with lots of tea for me and a selection of pastries this room was large enough for the number of guests using it and kept neat and tidy at all timesall in all the casablanca has quite ordinary guest rooms and public spaces what makes the place stand out are the staff and ill give you some examples the cleaning staff who clean and tidy rooms to a high standard the staff who work in ricks caf on the second floor there was always a member of staff in attendance making sure the room is clean and tidy and restocking cookies tea coffee and anything else that might run out the staff who work in reception check in and out was quick and efficient and they usually opened doors for us as we came and went all of the staff are bright and cheerful towards guests the manager took the time to introduce himself to us the location is pretty good personally i dont like times square but there are so many other places in nyc that i do like that are within a short walk it makes up for it there is also a good number of subway lines to choose from close byon the whole a good choicemy only minor negative comment is on the subject of value my night stay cost dollars including taxes which to me seems a little on the high side but may be quite normal for nyc,Positive
my husband and i spent days here from the st of november from the minute we arrived the staff couldnt have been more helpful it was my birthday on the nd and we enjoyed the complimentary bottle of champagne left in our rooma pleasant surprise indeed our room was ample in size with subtle touches such as turn down chocolates and mineral water our dinner river cruise was kindly booked for us by the hotel staff the atmosphere surrounding the presedentail elections is something we will never forget most notably the times square area we thoroughly enjoyed the refreshments available all day long especially the wine and cheese in the evenings we will most certainly be revisiting with our daughters in tow soon,Positive
we stayed at the casablanca at the end of october for nights it was our daughters th birthday present what a fabulous stay we had the staff were extremely helpful very knowledgable and pleasant and couldnt do enough for us the location is fantastic you step out of the door and there is times square if you are intending to visit the theatre then this place is perfect it is also perfect for other sights which are all within walking distance if you like to walk we didnt use the subway once fifth ave broadway empire state building central park grand central ny public library rockafeller centre nbc were all easily accessible from this locationthe inside of the hotel is lovely we stayed in the mini suite which was ideal quite roomy with a good sized ensuite all kept very clean the only downside and this is not the hotels fault was the noise at night we were at the front of the hotel and new yorkers love to use their car horns no matter what time of day or night it is if you are a light sleeper then take ear plugsbreakfast was fab a continental style which set us up for the day staff are again very accomadating and friendly at breakfast the room breakfast is served in is very relaxing soft furninshings sofas etc newspapers are there for you in the morning to read as you eat throughout the day hot and cold drinks are available as are cookies if you want to help yourself this i thought was a very nice touch and very welcoming at the end of the day the staff also layed out cheese and wine in an evening this again being one of those touches that is fully appreciated and adds to the stay i would definately stay here again i myself have every intention of coming back to new york it is one of the best cities in the world and i have visited many it is so easy to get around and there is so much to do we visited all the sites mentioned above as well as the statue of liberty and ellis island the museums and a broadway show there is still much more to do,Positive
ill start by saying that i prefer small hotels i usually stay at the hotel elysee in nyc which i love but this trip had more meetings nearer times square turns out this hotel is owned by the same company httpwwwhkhotelsushomeasp i was a bit concerned about noise in that area but my room was very quiet it was small bathroom door barely cleared the bed but it was wellappointed and cozy the bathroom also small but fine looked new with beautiful tile nice toiletries and it was spotless the cafe on the second floor is great for breakfast and a nice place to stop and regroup any time of the day as they have fresh coffee tea etc available all day long the staff was excellent everyone was eager to help and to please i would definitely stay in this hotel again or any of the hk hotels for that matter as i am pleased with both i have tried i am eager to try out the other two library and giraffe on my next trips,Positive
spent a four day shopping trip at this idealy placed very comfortable hotel staff were allways happy helpfull and made our stay easy and fun the rooms are comfy breakfast served in a lovely lounge area which was open all day for complinentary drinks and snacks perfectly positioned for the theatres or the shops just off times square,Positive
this is a fabulous hotel in an excellent location from the wonderful staff to the spotless bathrooms the comfortable beds small rooms yes but this is new york lovely decor complimentary breakfast tea coffee juice biscuits and pastries all day cheese and wine the list is endlessif you want a central location near everything this is the place for you a minutes walk from times square three minutes from the tour buses five minutes from fifth ave ten minutes from the empire state grand central station and the rockerfeller centre and the magnolia bakery worlds best cupcakes also only a minute walk from central park and tiffanyswe would return in an instant,Positive
we stayed at the casablanca at the beginning of october we booked it on the strength of all the excellent reviews on this website and we have to say that we were certainly not disappointedwe had travelled to new york for a night break with our month old baby in tow from the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were made to feel so welcome and nothing was ever too much troublefrom providing us with a fridge in our room to keep baby food cold to laura who boiled water and filled bottles for us every night the help and care that we received was faultlessin fact they even posted our two coats back to the uk for us when we accidently left them behind the room was spotless and large enough that it didnt feel cramped even with the cot and fridge which obviously wouldnt normally be there ricks cafe was a lovely place to chill out after a mad busy day and having the internet there was ideal for getting details of places to visit and to checkin for our flights homethe central location on times square was just amazing and although we had a room on the front of the hotel we were never bothered by the noise but then after pounding the streets of new york from morning til night i dont think anything would have kept us off our sleep we were always exhausted having been so impressed by our stay here we will most definitely return in the future,Positive
just got home after staying at this hotel for a week the standard of the room and the service was superb located yards from the hustle and bustle of times square yet step through the doors of the hotel casablanca and that is immediately left behind great value for money and generally the hotel gave us a great holiday experience n gough uk,Positive
recently stayed for nights in the casablanca hotel and from once we arrived to the time we checked out the service was fantasticthe room was beautifully appointed and although not huge there was plenty of space i had being worried about this having heard about the tiny rooms in many new york hotels the bathroom was spotless with fresh fluffy towels which were not only replaced every morning but also every evening if they had being usedricks cafe which was opened hours a day was a peaceful oasis only a few steps from times square breakfast was served there and tea coffee juices and biscuits were available all day free of charge complimentary wine and cheese were available between pm and pm every evening and was a great way to unwind after a hectic day shopping and sight seeing a computer with internet access was available in ricks cafe free of chargeshould i get the chance to return to new york i wont have to spend hours trawling through the internet looking for a hotel as i will be booking the casablanca hotel,Positive
weve been reluctant to stay in the times square area on our many trips to the city but a brief theatre visit made it a necessity this time we were beyond delighted with the attractiveness and serenity of the casablanca vanessa peter and other staff were cordial in the extreme and helpful in managing our luggage after checkout while we were at the theatre a major criterion for me is an immaculate bathroom and this one was flawless the lounge was beautifully done spacious and provided a lovely breakfast and nice food during the day members of our family not staying in the hotel who expected to wait for us in the lobby were instead invited to wait in the lounge with wine and cheese the hallways and our room were imaginatively decorated and spotless a renovation was completed years ago indicating that maintenance is a priorityour appreciation to staff and management for a fine visit,Positive
my daughter and i had a great stay to celebrate her st birthday the hotel provided the perfect antidote to a hectic round of shopping sightseeing and entertainment our room was comfortable clean and pleasant the atmosphere and refreshment facilities were welcome and welcoming and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful topped off by being in a perfect position a stones throw from times square yet relatively peaceful and quiet,Positive
my husband and i stayed here on the first leg of our honeymoon and absolutely loved it the hotel is small but so personal and the staff are so friendly amp helpful without being in your face we were given an upgrade on our room plus a bottle of champagne as a token because of being on our honeymoon room was fabulous clean amp comfortable although quite small but it is new york and we were not spending much time in the room complimentary breakfast food and wine was much appreciated and very nice free internet in the lounge was great and always working yes maybe you have to wait a few minutes but hey not much to quibble about really location could not be any better literally in times square fabulous restaurants nearby and always felt very safe cannot wait to come back to new york and we will definitly be staying in the casablanca again big thank you to john the manager who gave us great advice on all the sights restaurants and nightlife he made us feel so welcome and is a credit to the hotel,Positive
we stayed in this hotel for two nights precruise on the strength of reviews on tripadvisormust say it was an excellent choice we were travel weary when we arrived after a transatlantic flight and we requested a quiet room at the back the staff at the checkin were most helpful and cheerful and gave us what we needed the room was very comfortable and clean and had complimentary internet facillities in the roomit was an oasis from the buzz of the ny streets excellent location within a stones throw of times square ricks cafe on the second floor welcomed us with complimentary wine and cheesethe staff at the front door were most helpful and really went out of their way to make our stay comfortable they are to be complimentedwill certainly go back again,Positive
marvelous service from all the staff superb location very comfortable rooms the evening wine and cheese is something that other hotels should try it certainly facilitates guests to mingle and share tourist advice wish i could afford to go back for new year celebrations the restaurant next door toni di napoli is also very good but make sure you are famishedthe portions are hugetony and maggie e sussexengland,Positive
fantastic welcome on arrival straight away all the staff were willing to help and made us feel right at home checking that we had everything we needed as it was my th birthday the hotel manager had organised a personal meet and greet and offered complimentary champagne on a day of my choosing and we were upgraded to a fantastic suite on entering our room we were greeted by a large room and bathroom with an extra large comfortable bed again more complimentary goodies wine water bath robes slippers good size tv an excellent start to the day was the breakfast which offered a good selection of continental choices this was an added bonus as a lot of ny hotels charge extra for breakfast or do not have this available during the day tea coffee lattes etc are available with fruit and cookies and you can just help yourself from pm pm the hotel offers wine cheese and crackers as another complimentary this was particularly useful when we had show tickets at pm and didnt want to eat a big meal beforehandthe hotel was in a great location for theatres shopping and everything else you would want to see while you are hereoverall experience of this hotel made new york trip even more special and i would definately stay here again if i came backcouldnt fault a thing,Positive
the casablanca is in a wonderful location and is truly an oasis next to the chaos of times square its easy to get around in manhattan and the hotel is somewhat centrally located for the major sites the decor is nicely done and everything was clean ricks cafe was a great place to relax but room selection is key initally we ended up in a room on rd street which was too noisy for me but not my roommate we moved to a room in the back of the hotel things were quieter but our window and ac unit looked out on vents from nearby restaurants and the room had an odor of food another party spending the time with us stayed in a more central room though they had a fullsize bed instead of a queen size their window and ac looked out on a courtyard adjoining ricks and they did not have a problem with noise or odor i would definitely stay at the casablanca again but only if i could get a room such as or for example the front desk staff was very helpful and responsive there were issues of slow drains but that seems to be a common problem in hotels a good value for the money especially if you can get a room such as or,Positive
what a lovely place to stay because of its small size only rooms it meant that you certainly got personalised service from the turn down service of a night to the charm and friendliness of the staff it could not be faulted centrally located so seeing all the new york has to offer was a breeze but lovely and quite inside nice to come back and relax towould and have recommended it to all my friends and would definately stay there again,Positive
we cant imagine a better place to stay in new york the location is perfect being within mins walk of central park empire state building grand central station rockefeller building broadway theatres macys etc and no more than yds from times squarethe breakfast suited us perfectly with a great choice and ricks cafe is also pleasantly appointed with a handy computer for keeping in touch the idea of breakfast without going out and searching for a diner was just what we wanted although there is a diner within yardsthe evening wine and cheese party is a nice touch and staff were courteous at all times we thought that the supply of umbrellas for guests usage on the one night it rained to be going that extra mileray amp jacky king,Positive
we stayed here for three nights after reading the good reviews on this site firstly i would say that the location is brilliant just off times square and within walking distance of a lot of tourist sites we had a room at the back and it was so quiet you would not believe you were in the middle of the city the room itself while not a large room was perfect for our needs the complimentary coffee and biscuits available all day was a welcome treat as was the cheese and wine in the evening breakfast was available in ricks cafe every morning and there was a good selection available we found the staff to be courteous and overall enjoyed our stay,Positive
i spend weeks a year in new york city mostly for business but sometimes for pleasure and have tried numerous hotels rated on trip advisor usually with excellent results i will not come back to hotel casablancaalthough the hotel has some nice amenities that they are proud of such as wine and cheese from pm that didnt make up for the lack of security and the horrible horrible sausage smell in our room yes sausage i was also sorely disappointed with the level of professionalism and service from the front desk staffsecurity first as that is a more specific and tangible concern there is usually just one person behind the front desk and when we walked in at pm on sunday evening no doorman except once during the three days and two nights we were there he didnt even look up from whatever he was doing and only greeted us when we were already up the stairs this is in times square literally in the square it is so crowded and it just felt like anyone could walk right in the room we stayed in had only one deadbolt and no chain and although its a nice place i found that strange there are two doors to enter the hotel and no one opened them for us everwhen we checked in the clerk offered to upgrade us from a full size room to a queen noting that we had requested fragrance and featherfree although he offered to upgrade and we accepted there was no upgrade the room was actually a full size bed and alas while clean and spacious for a nyc hotel room and i have stayed in many reeked of sausage when we first opened the door each time we returned to the room we were assaulted with the smells i attribute the odor to the window unit air conditioner and the proximity of restaurants when i first went down to ask to change the room the clerk did not apologize said there was no room to change us to and handed me a can of air freshener i told him that we were trying to avoid chemicals and that using air freshener would just make the room smell like chemicals and sausage even carnivores would be nauseated by clothing hair and bedding saturated with pork smellsthe next day i told them again how unpleasant it was and they told me that the manager wasnt there but he would be finally john the manager came in at am and suddently magically there was a room available he at first offered to reduce the room rate but when he moved us into a suite withdrew that offer the suite did not smell like sausage but by the time we were in it we were so grossed out it was not worth it we regretted ever coming to the casablanca when we discovered the dvd remote didnt work and that it was ancient and apparently not exchangable the front desk guy came up and tried to help but told us that he would have to replace the dvd player as it was pm we told him that it would have to be tomorrowa last note on the staff they were proud of their designation on this site as one of the best in the city however they were not happy and did not hesitate to express their feelings one guy behind the desk mentioning no names as not to get him into trouble seemed clinically depressed and shared his feelings of malaise about new york with usoverall i am disattisfied with the level of customer service casual to the extreme and the lack of concern the staff had once we complained twice more about the sausage we were told that everyone on our side of the building was having trouble with the smell quotno one has ever complained about this beforequot i asked quotnever this is the first timequotthis hotel is immaculately clean the wine and cheese time generous but its not worth itafter writing this i cancelled another reservation i had on the website luckily i kept the cancellation information last month as i was happily ensconced in the west th townhouse great place i got a call from the hotel asking me why i had not arrived for my nine day reservation it took a bit of back and forth i forwarded my cancellation email to them but finally they saw that i had cancelled they did not charge my card in advance thankfully,Positive
i chose the casablanca from the good reviews on this site my british inlaws had never been to new york and we thought what better way to do it than place them in the middle of it in times square overall we had a good stay with a few notable exceptions the pull out bed in our suite was absolutely atrocious the middle sagged so much that with two people in the bed you would both slide into a crevice those mattresses need to be changed asap why advertise a suite with a pull out bed when this pull out bed is so useless of course we could not move since the hotel was sold out the socalled quotfree wireless never worked we were told to call the quotit departmentquot and were on the phone with this person for mins and in the end it never worked i kept calling the front desk and they said it was a problem in the entire building from the reviews here it seems the wireless rarely works yes there is a computer you can use in the lounge but there always seemed to be someone on it so when you needed to check on an address or something you could not there should be a posted sign about a minute maximum especially when others need to use the computer the good things great breakfast as long as you dont need a huge american style spread and hot drinks always available and daily newspapers nice wine amp cheese in the evening so what if its not expensive wines it was still a nice touch central location for touristy things many subway stops and places to see within walking distance,Positive
we stayed here after reading the reviews on this site the casablanca is in an excellent location just off times square the real bonuses of this hotel were free teacoffeebiscuits all day and the cheese and wine reception between pm each evening breakfast was also good quality the staff were friendly and helpfulricks cafe provides a home from home living room and free internet access complete with printing facilities we would definitely stay here again a couple of tips we picked up from the reviews and would agree with are to request a rear facing room nice and quiet and to book the superior room for a bit of extra spaceenjoy it,Positive
amazing location top quality rooms amp facilities with great service from all the staff we encounteredthe room was not the biggest but fairly large by ny standards amp surprisingly quiet given its location about yards from times squarethe breakfast was a good selection of fruit lots of different pastries amp more coffeetea options than your average starbucksevening cheese amp wine was unbelievable choice of red wine or sparkling wine or water juice tea etc if you prefer with approx different cheeses to choose fromthe hotel is certainly not cheap we paid approx for nights but for peace of mind for a quality ny hotel id certainly recommend staying here,Positive
couldnt speak more highly of this hotel it is in a great location but once inside you woulnt know times square was so close by after travelling the world for weeks we would rate the staff here and the davanzati in florence equal best they were so friendly and helpful i hurt my back while staying here and they were exceptionaly caring the only problem we had was our first room although very big was noisy at night as it faced the street we asked to be moved after nights and we were moved to a much quieter although smaller and darker room at the back of the hotel this really didnt matter though as you really only spend the night in the room and sleep is most important breakfast was satisfactory and happy hour is a nice touch next time would get a cab from the airport as they have a set price rather than the shuttle which felt unsafe with too much luggage and no barrier between passengers and luggage would definetely return here,Positive
the hotel casablanca is an excellent choice for a stay in new york it is very central and located close to times square and although it doesnt have great views like some of the bigger hotels may have it is a little quieter due to being just off times square and is much more friendly and personal due to the size of the hotel all of the staff were extremely pleasant and happy to assist with any requests we really enjoyed the complimentary continental breakfast each morning i had expected that we would eat breakfast out a few times but we really didnt feel the need to so in the end and ate in the hotel each morning there is a choice of cereals croissants pastries muffins yoghurts fruit salad bagels boiled eggs cheese and preserves there is teacoffeehot chocolate available all day which is a nice touch and in the evening there is cheese and biscuits and wine which is also complimentary and a nice way to tide you over until dinner i dont drink much but really looked forward to the good selection of cheese and occasional glass of sparkling wine each evening the rooms were also of a high standard as was cleanliness throughout the hotel our room was a little small and did not have great storage space for unpacking but i think this is pretty standard for new york hotels from what i have read and didnt really bother us the only gripe we had was that although there is free internet the connection wasnt great i am not sure if this was because we were on the th floor i think i read this on another review on here or because of the amount of business users in the area as it did seem to improve at the weekend again this was only a minor thing for us and there is a pc in the lounge area for use along with a printer which was better if you need something quickly the hotel also had a nice little terrace area just off the lounge where you could sit outside amongst some greenery however as it rained pretty much most of the time we were there people didnt use it much at all overall our stay was excellent and we would definitely return to this hotel again for the great location friendly staff and tasty cheese and winebreakfasts,Positive
nice boutique hotel just steps from times square stayed four nights in midseptember and it couldnt have been better room was a bit small but very clean staff very friendly helpful and eager to please the breakfast and nightly wine amp cheese was a nice touch will be back again,Positive
we had a great experience at the casablanca we arrived early and our room was ready the staff is very friendly and helpful the casablanca is only a block from times square and is fairly priced for the accomodations we were able to walk to dinner and our play the staff member who helped us with directions to the statue of liberty was very specific which was great as we had never used the subway system before we would definitely stay there again,Positive
my sisterinlaw and i enjoyed our stay at this excellent hotel staff were friendly and helpful rooms lovely and a perfect size breakfast and wine and cheese was a nice touch only a few yards from times square but no noise at allan oasis of calm to come back to after pounding the streets highly recommended,Positive
we are two couples from sydney australia who stayed at the casablanca hotel for days in the middle of september we found the hotel oustanding in every respect need to view this hotel as the total package it is located right in the heart of times square rooms and bathrooms are spotless and well furnished decor in rooms and hallways is impressive and the piece de resistance is ricks cafe on the second floor with access to hour coffee snacks etc and free wine and cheese every evening also free internet access in the cafe this was a great place to relax and meet other guests this is a boutique hotel so will not offer all the amenities of a larger chain but this is what made the hotel so far as we were concerned smaller friendly staff and place to relax and socialise outside of your room when we arrived one room was very noisy and we asked to be moved this was no problem and we were quickly located to another room on the other side of the hotel received excellent service from all staff with a special mention for zishan and hassan who were exceptional in providing information and for their courtesy and friendly approach the hotel is certainly not in the budget category but we considered it worth the money especially given the substantial complimentary breakfast all day snacks and free wine from pm to pm we would definitely return,Positive
we found our stay at the casablanca pretty goodas some other reviewers have said the rooms are pretty small but spotlessly clean with the right decorthe public areas also are very nice and the endless complimentary coffee and cookies are great after a long evening in the city to unwind and rest those feetyou couldnt get any nearer to times sq if you tried the location is absolutely a although you do need a tolerance to the new york din if you have an outside roomon arrival the friendly staff couldnt get my credit card to be accepted however after a few heart flutters they apologised as the guy had entered the details incorrectlywe were presented on entering the room with a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine which was a nice touch and although we didnt get the room i had requested they did move us the following day with no hassle at all in fact the bags etc were all moved by the casablanca staff whilst we were out very smoothoverall a nice small clean well run hotelplus points location staff complimentary wine and breakfastminus points noise at front of hoteldarren and lisa doddington cambs,Positive
our third stay at this hotel and would be reluctant to stay elsewhere in ny having stayed in a couple of other hotels previouslyyes it may not be the cheapest but the facilities are brilliant hour refreshments breakfast cheese and wine in the evenings use them all and you really get your moneys worththe rooms are spotless even if they are not very big who wants to spend time in a hotel roomthe staff are really friendly and welcomingthe location is great times square is a few steps away but so is the subway so an escape from the noise and crowds is easy,Positive
we booked the casablanca after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and in the main would agree with the majority of these we arrived earlier than expected and were greeted by a friendly doorman and our room was ready we stayed for nights asked for a quiet room and this was provided i stayed in a suite with my parents and we were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room having read previous reviews we expected no space at all but found plenty of room for all our stuff the bathroom is lovely and spacious and complimentary toiletries were gorgeous tip dont take your own the housekeeping staff were fabulous bringing clean towels and fresh toiletries every morning and afternoon and the room was spotless tvs in the bedroom and living area stopped any arguments over the remote too this is definitely an oasis to come back to after a hard days sightseeing breakfast and cheese and wine saved us alot of money and were welcomed the staff in ricks cafe were great couldnt do enough for us and the computer access was really helpful to check on things we met some great people staying in the hotel and it is definitely a much more friendly relaxed environment than some of the larger chains the door staff were very friendly too offering a welcome smile and cheery goodbye when entering and leaving the hotel on the downside some of the reception staff did not appear to have a great knowledge of local restaurants and were not overly helpful this seemed to depend on who was on duty some of the other staff were great and very helpful and friendly looking at previous reviews this does seem to vary and this was our experience the day staff were certainly much friendlier and genuine perhaps others were just fed up working nights unfortunately the bottle of champagne we were hoping for on my mums birthday did not materialise as written in a previous review this was a bit disappointing as we had hoped for a special day for her and this would have been a nice touch the hotel needs to keep on top of things and not get complacent regarding their position in trip advisor otherwise they will quickly find themselves slipping down the ratings all in all this was a great stay and we would definitely stay here again perhaps keep an open mind and dont expect too much and you wont be disappointed make your own itinerary and do your research before you go then youre not reliant on others to plan your trip the hotel is great and the location could not be better literally just off times square the rooms are not as small as some i have seen and perfectly adequate for new york this really is a little oasis and inside the hotel we couldnt hear any noise from outside i doubt you would find anywhere better in manhatten at the prices paid,Positive
we booked the casablanca after reading reviews on trip advisor we arrived just after lunch so we did not expect our room to be ready and we checked in and left our bags to take a tour and arrived back after pm we had booked a deluxe king room and had requested a room at the back of the hotel when we were shown to our room it was a very small double room more in keeping with a single room at the quiet rear end of the hotel we contacted reception to be told there were no other rooms available in the hotel but they agreed it was not a king room but the hotel was full the next day we had another full daytrip booked and found we had been moved to another room this time a kingsize but at the front of the hotel and we were given a bottle of champagne they also made a deduction to the cost of our nightly rate the second room was a bit larger with a king bed but unfortunately at the front of the building which is very noisy we decided not to ask to be moved again and bought some earplugs which did help the staff in the hotel are very good polite and helpful and will do whatever they can to make your stay a good one but our stay was not ideal as we were checking out we were met by the manager who apologised for the problems and we were given a complimentary stay if we would like to return in the future this was a nice gesture but we had asked to see the manager from the day we arrived and i feel his apology was a little late in the day we had booked this hotel a long time ago directly on their website and expected better than this from a hotel with such good reviews,Positive
only stay here if you can get a room for under usd i have found many great hotels around the world because of the reviews on tripadvisor this is the first time i have not agreed with the majority the service at the hotel is apparently not what it used to be i booked the hotel for a weekend for my parents i wanted to pay for their stay and stopped by the hotel i live in nyc a few days before and left my credit card info the clerk at the desk assured me that all would be billed to my card and most importantly that my parents would not see the bill he even said he would make a note on the reservation that they were not to see how much the rooms were well i saw my mom after their stay and she handed me the bill which she was asked to sign that included the charges for the room the first room they were given on the rd floor had garbage left in it and imprints in the bed from where someone had been lying on it my folks called the front desk and the manager asked quotwhat would you like to doquot what kind of question is that my mom said she was not happy about sleeping in a bed someone had already laid in so they offered them a new room that should have been the first thing out of the mangers mouth not quotwhat do you want to doquot the room they were given on the th floor was small and a bit worn around the edges they were also promised a bottle of champagne on the second night for my fathers birthday which never arrived my parents called the front desk who proceeded to question whether they were telling the truth or not about the missing champagnethe area around the hotel is under heavy construction so make sure to ask for a quiet room this was at least a request that the staff at the casablanca honored for us,Positive
i do not understand the negative reviews of this hotel we were very impressed as soon as the doorman greeted us at the entrance check in was a breeze we arrived before noon so our room wasnt ready but that was expected we asked the front desk clerk for directions to a pub we wanted to try he looked them up on the internet called the facility to confirm that they were open and reviewed the directions with them to make sure we would find it thats service other staff memebers were equally helpful and very friendlythe rooms are small but very clean as others have stated we had a room facing the courtyard and did not hear a bit of noise from the cityas others have stated the continental breakfast was a huge plus assorted juices coffee tea milk yogurt fruit salad pastries bagels oatmeal etc the wine and cheese in the evening was welcomed after a long day of sightseeingdo yourself a favor and stay at this hotel location service comfort cleanliness and a good value for nyc,Positive
we have just returned from a weeks stay at the casablanca located around the corner from times square we were not expecting the oasis behind the entrance lobby it is very difficult to add to the reviews written about this hotel it is everything amp more than we had hoped for room was comfortable with everything we needed the one downside was the noisy airconditioning which didnt seem to want to turn off however we found that we got used to it the service was excellent and when i needed a doctor an appointment was made amp we were sightseeing within an hourwe can also recommend tonys next door excellent food amp service especially after a busy day they will also deliver to your rooma real plus if you dont want to go out again refreshments were on offer all dayamp another nice touch was the cheese amp wine in the early evening all in all a lovely relaxing stay in a great locationwe would love to return to enjoy another visit,Positive
great location clean amp comfortable room with a nice morroccan theme big bathroom and closet were a plus however one big drawback internet connection on my floor f was exasperatingly slow and i had to come down to the lounge on the nd floor for a reasonable speed overall great hotel for pleasure but stay away from casablanca hotel if youll be in nyc on business,Positive
my wife amp i recently travelled from scotland amp spent days at the casablanca from arrival to departure we were superbly looked after by all staff the arrangement in ricks cafe for breakfast tea coffee fruit amp snacks during the day amp wine with nibbles in the evening was the best hospitality possibleour room was british standard size so we were comfortable amp had adequate space being at the rear of the hotel the disturbance from city centre traffic was minimalthe location is perfect only of our paces from times square therefore close to theatres amp many restaurantsthe standard of service can be summarised by the offer to us when we left in a downpour they suggested that we take one of the hotel umbrellas with us in case we were exposed to heavy rain when leaving our taxi at the airport buildingin our view there can be no better hotel in new york for locationamp effciency of staff if we return to new york there is only one hotel on our list the casablanca,Positive
we stayed here over the weekend september and were to be frank slightly disappointed but not surprised having read some of the more objective reviews here and on other sites yes the hotel is conveniently located but its far from peaceful although we were upgraded to a king suite this was street facing and incredibly noisy so be warned if you get a room at the front it will not be an oasis there are construction sites more or less opposite where they work all night and the traffic is incessant on the quotplusquot side the air conditioning units are so loud they will drown out any external noise the rooms are not soundproof as they advertise but our room was spacious very clean and comfortable however we had virtually no sleep for nights as others have said ricks cafe is very nice but lacks enough tables for breakfast there are only not really enough for rooms where you can sit normally otherwise you need to have your breakfast sitting on settees or low chairs or get down early before the business people with their laptops monopolise these tables the wine and cheese in the evening and all day pastries and drinks are a welcome touch and the staff in there are kind and polite id also echo some others comments about the reception staff helpful to a point but not overly sowe ate in the associated toni di napoli restaurant one night but unless you and your partners want the same dish avoid it they only serve indifferent food for or people they wouldnt even prepare a single side salad its basically a family fastfood place with abrasive staff walk a few blocks and there are much better places to eat all in all dollars including taxes for nights at a standard room rate even though we were upgraded isnt value for money in this hotel and im sure as others have stated there are probably much better options the minus points outweigh any good points and we wouldnt return read all trip advisor comments about this hotel its easy to get carried away with the effusive peaceful haven impression that some convey,Positive
lovely hotel great location would stay againinitial impressions were that it was rather dull and dark but by the end of the first day the moroccan theme had rather grown on me free breakfast and early evening snacks were very welcome,Positive
excellent little oasis off the clamour of times square the hotel is made by the friendliness of all the staff who were always willing to smile to help and to go the extra mile the snacks breakfast wine cheese and ambience of ricks cafe also add to the ease and enjoyment of the experience would much rather stay here than some of the grander hotels of new york that we met relatives inas with other travellers the only minor down side was the size of the bedroom however it was immaculately clean peaceful comfortable and had all the additional extras that one could wish forwould definitely come back here if visiting new york,Positive
based on all the glowing remarks given to this hotel i too booked my first trip to ny in the care of the casablanca and what a pleasant stay it was as mentioned by all the others the location is fantastic step outside and bam youre in times square step back into the hotel and youd never even know you were in a big city the rooms are small but exceptionally well decorated completely updated and very clean the staff is attentive pleasant and eager to help in any way and the complimentary items wine amp cheese each night breakfast dvds internet access were better than expected but most important the mattresses were awesome firm with nice linens i dont normally sleep well in hotels so this was an exception book with confidence,Positive
this is my first time writing a review for tripadvisor but as i travel loads and use this site i thought i would start to contribute firstly i do like casablanca but i liked it more a few years ago when it was indeed a find and when the rates were slightly better nyc is expensive and i realise the hotel rates youll not get anything below or so reflect this but the comparatively the hotel was always a bit more of a good find in terms of cost not just the little extrasthe hotel is nicely situated it is right in time square and despite its location if you get a back or inner room it is fairly quiet if you get a front room expect street noise the rooms are fine the twin room is quite spacious and nice and is my favourite as it is toward the back but they have very few of these and so harder to get the king size premium rooms that are inner are bigger than the standard but not large by any means the decour inside the rooms is fine but there is a slight feel of it becoming worn there is now free wifi in the rooms which is great there is also a machine on the nd floors ricks the big plus is that the hotel does have a continental breakfast included with all rates and they do a nice winecheese every night from what has changed and only in some cases is that the front desk staff really is so varied in how they meetgreet guests when we checked in i was less than overwhelmed by the greeting i have stayed there x per year over the last few years but then a change in front staff and a whole different vibe what is consistent is the doorman who are great so a bit mixed whereas i do remember a time when it was just consistently friendly and just that nice home feeli think if you decide to stay here do it for the following you like a smaller hotel you want that central westside location and you will take advantage of the breakfasts and happy hour and there is coffee and pastries all day so you can come back and chill out in this nd floor area particularly good if you are travelling with an elderly person or children or just in inclement weather do not stay here if you like something more modern with more in house facilities of the time square hotels this would be the one i definitely prefer in short it is nice but i find the slot it is occupying now a bit over the top for what the hotel actually provides,Positive
we stayed at this place after a recommendation from a friend and how we need to thank him the place is so close to the action of times square yet once you fight your way through the crowds to get in the door it is just so tranquil in the hotel its hard to believe when you are in the hotel how close you are to times squarecheck in was efficient with no hassling to take our bags when we were quite capable to carry them ourselves the standard room is small there is no other way of putting it but it does the jobone of the best things is the lounge on the nd floor very peaceful with lots of reading material a tv and a free internet terminal evening wine and cheese is excellent as it the breakfasttonis the restaurant next door does good italian food till quite lateall in all a great place well worth the money i would not look for some where else if i return to ny ill be straight back heretop tip ask for quiet room that does not face the street it could be a bit noisy if you do although i can not quantify how noisy we asked and got a courtyard facing room that was very quiet,Positive
we had a fantastic stay at the casablanca during the first week of the us open staff was very very helpful when there was a minor mixup with our roomextremely accommodating also winecheese and breakfast included in the price beds were very comfy with nice soft sheets and good pillows my husband often travels to ny for business and he will definitely stay again and highly recommends great location too,Positive
we selected casablanca based on reviews posted on trip advisor and were definitely not disappointed the hotel was very nice staff very nice and professional as well as helpful and the location was perfect we definitely will return,Positive
this was our third stay in nyc but the first time in casablanca until now we havent really liked nyc but after our visit to casablanca we really want to go back when making our onlie resevation we almost instantly got a personal email back which we replied to with some personal preferences this was also replied to almost instantly which felt great upon arrival we were friendly greeted and taken care of in a professional manner the hotel features a few things not always found in a hotel but are nice such as the free wine and cheese in the afternoonthe location was great with times square just outside the door and still the interior of the hotel featured a very quiet and relaxed atmosphere,Positive
we visited from greece and spent six days in this magnificent hotelit was our first visit to the city great hotel very polite and helpful staff very clean hotel also a real oasis in the madness of times square,Positive
lived up to our expectations a truly peaceful respite from the craziness of times square we had a problem with the car service pick up but the front desk made amends for the consequent delay otherwise perfect,Positive
i cant believe it took us so long to find this oasis from the minute i walked in the door and was greeted by the staff i knew i would never stay anywhere else it was a wonderful place and i couldnt believe that it was so close to everything yet once you were inside it was a haven from the frantic times square it had so many lovely touches the lady playing the piano on friday evening the way the staff remembered who you were the evening check for new towels i have been to new york many times but never felt so pampered and cared for the room was small but just perfect for our needs and spotless i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants more than a bed to sleep on,Positive
every review about the casablanca proved to be true as my daughter and i found out after our week in nyc from the welcoming email to our checkout at am we were treated like queens by the friendly staff in this most comfortable hotel each morning we were greeted by smiles and everyone was so eager to help us on our way and then welcome us back each evening the location of the hotel at times square could not have been more perfect thank you all and we will certainly recommend you to our friends there should be a six star rating for inns like yoursmarelyn ballany winnipeg canada,Positive
have just returned from two nights at the casablanca great hotel with a large but first the positives fantastic location great staff cheese and wine and a good breakfast all included we arrived and they upgraded us to a king suite for free but in retrospect that was where the rather large but came along the room was at the front of the hotel and they are building along the street the trouble is this building work is hours a day we had loading and unloading of lorries all night and even jackhammers at am we both really struggled to sleep and i am not a light sleeper overall a really great hotel but be very careful about the room you are assigned whilst the building is going on down the street,Positive
this was our second stay at casablanca and it was as enjoyable as our first stay we stayed nights this hotel goes out of its way to be accommodating with staff that are just downright helpful and friendly and seem as happy to be at the hotel as we are we especially enjoy ricks cafe on the second floor that is available to guests hours a day for reading a refreshing snack or to catch up with your email every morning a delicious breakfast is available and every evening wine and cheese and crackers are served to guests in ricks cafe as well the rooms are beautifully clean and although on the small side for someone from the midwest they are welldesigned and comfortable especially the beds we love the casablanca hotel my only disappointment this trip was that when we wanted to extend our stay one night we couldnt because they were full,Positive
the casablanca is a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of times square brits think oxford street x it is small with friendly staff and none of the excesses of the large manhatten hotels the rooms are bit on the small side but the beds were extremely comfortable the shower worked the continental style buffet and other complimentary offerings during the evening were very goodcouldnt fault it would definitely return if in new york,Positive
my husband and i stayed at the casablanca for nights at the beginning of august we were in new york for a wedding this was the perfect baseit was just what we wanted comfy bed good bathroom plenty of storage in the bedroom handy situation just off times square with subway round the cornerstaff could not have been more helpful recommending restaurants and booking cars for the airportbreakfast was excellent and the wine and cheese in the evening a lovely touchwill definitely be back,Positive
stayed at the casablanca for four nights on our first ever trip to new york whilst we probably had the smallest room we have ever stayed in it did not detract in any way from our enjoyment of this hotel ricks cafe was a tranquil oasis away from the bustle of times square and the evening cheese and wine was a lovely touch breakfast was good it saved the hassle of finding somewhere to eat and provided a relaxing start to long sightseeing days we would definitely return to this hotel,Positive
we stayed in the casablanca for nights at the start of august and had a fantastic stay the hotel is so neare to everything th avenue times square and the bus to the outlets thought the breakfast was great with lots of choice and a relaxing start to the day and the drinks reception was fab too staff really nice and plesant we stayed on the th floor and our room was great really big with huge bed and equally spacious bathroom just to note we did book a superiour room so maybe th estrandard rooms are a lot smaller yes there was some noise from the street below in the early morning but we kept the window closed it is new york after all and i dont think the hotel can be blamed for things like bin collection and police sirens we actually got engaged while we were there and told the concierege on the night it happened as we were going out for dinner and he immediatly sent up a complimentary bottle of champage to our room this was on top of the other complimentary bottle we got as it was a special birthday holiday for me in the first place was a lovely intimate boutique hotel with a warm welcome and great service so on top of my engagement surprise it really was the best holiday ever,Positive
this hotel is just what we needed after a busy noisy day sightseeing the location is ideal if you are wanting to be in the hub of the theartre districtthe staff are wonderfulour room was a good size and the bathroom was excellent the only complaint was how noisy the aircon unit was and we did have to turn it off to get a good night sleepthe inclusion of breakfast and wine and cheese in the evening was an excellent way to start a busy morning or eveningthis hotel was a charming find,Positive
very impressed with this hotel great location just a few steps from times square while being a complete oasis of calm inside we had a deluxe queen room which was perfectly adequate for two with a large bathroom and walk in closet no view as the room was facing an inside courtyard but this was fine with us as it kept the room quiet or as quiet as a room can be with the standard us window mounted airconditionerthe hotel is tastefully and thoughtfully furnished with lots of interesting touches following the adopted theme very much a privately run quality individual hotel rather than the corporate styleall of the staff were friendly and efficient the quality of the interior furnishings and catering was excellent we really appreciated the wine and cheese receptions as a break between daytime sightseeing and going back out in the eveningbreakfasts were equally enjoyable with a good choice of cereals fresh fruit pastries and hot drinks refreshments were available all day and these were complimentary which was a nice touchthoroughly recommended,Positive
we had no complaints at all about this property it is super close to times square and the heart of the theatre district but very quiet and many amenitites breakfast snacks wine and cheese reception goodsized bathroom nice toiletries not to mention fabulous service jeffrey was especially helpful if we go back to ny would definitely stay here again,Positive
we stayed in the casablanca september had a fantastic time granted our room was overlooked by the fire escape stairs and just above the outside terrace but hey in new york who stays in their room for very long we absolutely loved the hotel the staff were great location great even though it is situated only a few yards from times square you would never have known amazed evertime we stepped outside to see broadway etc continental breakfast was great with a good variety complimentary cheese and wine every evening about pm with a pianist on fridays this all took place in ricks room on nd floor which was open hrs so if you came back at am you could still help yourself to teacoffee etc place was kept spotless definitely going back in a year or two,Positive
we were very impressed with the casablanca very clean well organized and oh so quiet the staff are extremely friendly and helpful prompt and courteous when we needed assistance the breakfast is a very nice touch so much better than braving the noisy street so early in the morning hope to someday get a chance to stay there again,Positive
this was my first trip to new york and we enjoyed our stay at the casablanca although some aspects of the hotel could have been betterwe booked it well in advance and stayed a week so i was a bit disappointed to find that our room was quite small and dark it overlooked the internal stairwell which had the smoking area of the breakfast room in it and a smoky smell often entered our room through the aircon unit on arrival we found the carpet disconcertingly damp perhaps it had been shampooed after the departure of some earlier messy occupants the bathroom had a fabulous spacious shower and lovely toiletriesi liked the morrocan themed decor running throughout the hotel and the communal areas and room were both very cleanthe breakfast room was a pleasant place to be very calm after the hustle and bustle of manhattan early evening wine and cheese sessions were most enjoyable at peak breakfast times the room could be rather overcrowded and some of the low cane furniture was not ideal for eating breakfast especially for those travelling with childrenthe hotel is in a superb location we walked most places the subway is handy toothe staff were brilliant very friendly and welcoming just what you need after a horrendous time getting through immigration at the airport and extremely helpful recommending places to visit restaurants to eat at and other local information,Positive
it was a great relief for us everyday after we been walking up and down on the streets of ny to come back to this nice hotel located right at the center of everything and still so quiet when you get inside nice rooms friendly staff and the complementary wine and cheesebuft between and pm made our stay perfectthe swedish couple in room,Positive
we stayed three nights at the casablanca we really researched a lot of hotels before choosing this one and we were not disappointed its location just off times square puts you right in the centre of manhattan perfectly placed for sightseeing and yet once inside the hotel it is quiet and very comfortablewe requested a quiet room and they obliged us our room on the th floor was at the back of the hotel so no view but we were grateful as it was so quiet at night the room was a reasonable size with a comfortable queen bedthe hotel staff are very friendly and helpful the continental breakfast included in the price is very good and a very nice touch is the free cheese wine coffee etc from pm to pmthe interior is moroccan style and very clean and well deocrated and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting new york,Positive
casablanca is a really nice hotel and much better than most that new york has to offerthe staff were really excellent and sincere in their efforts to make our stay as good as it could bea special mention to the concierge who got us an evening table at gramercy tavern at very short notice thanks againthe room suffered slightly from noise from adjacent rooftop air con units but was otherwise a good size for new york location is great if you are after times square but there are plenty of other sites in easy walking distance and the subway gives you easy access to the rest of the citybasically this place represents better value than most places in new york and the staff are top rate,Positive
i would echo all the positives about this hotel and would probably stay here again if the price is ok i paid for nights in july and given the location i was happy with thatrooms are small i can only compare to hilton garden inn a couple of blocks away which had much bigger rooms and beds where i stayed first time i visited but this year the price was too high and i went for this placei used the limo service back to newark which was great and cost including tips and tolls and suited us for a hassel free last daybreakfast nice as is free wine noticed some guests seemed to over use this service seems they saw it as a money saving excercise rather than go out and eat which is a shamei think the hotel is best suited to couples and the staff were all very friendly my only concern was the lack of visible security no one asked to seee any id when we came in at night which they certainly did at the hilton last year before you were allowed on the elevatori,Positive
excellent experience great location close to everything staff and hotel extremely accommodating clean rooms nice ammenities cant wait to return,Positive
just back from a one week stay booked the casablanca for our first new york trip based on tripadvisor reviews we could not have made a better choice if your looking for a friendly clean hotel in the perfect location you cant see past the casablanca one of the reasons we booked this hotel was because of the location we prefer walking to using the subway and you can walk to everywhere from here we even walked to the staten island ferry as everyone has already mentioned ricks cafe is a great place to meet people and the breakfast is perfect for setting you up for the day we always used the complimentary cheese wine coffee etc either after a day out or before going out for the evening the staff are just perfect we were offered a quiet room at the back of the hotel and had no noise problems at all considering our close proximity to times square metreswhen we go back to new york well definitely use the casablanca hotel,Positive
having read the reviews of this hotel on trip advisor we booked a stay for a first trip to new york fantastic location just off time square reception couldnt have been more helpfulspecial thanks to michael for introducing us to the new york metscomplementary wine and cheese is served each evening from to which was most welcome after a heavy day shopping on th avenue our room was quite basic although very clean but hey how much time do you spend sitting in your room staring at the wallshighly recommended,Positive
the hotel staff was very helpful in making our stay comfortable the location is right on times square and a perfect distance from the broadway theaters shopping and restaurants this is a great place to stay if you are looking for something other than the larger chains well be back,Positive
my husband daughter and i spent nights at the casablanca and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish everyone from the bellman and the front desk to the housekeepers were polite friendly and helpful the beds were comfortable and the room was tastefully decorated and spotless as everyone has said the casablanca is close to all times square attractions yet when you are in your room you could be out in the country it is so quiet the breakfast and afternoonevening wine and cheese were delightful most of all we want to thank everyone at the front desk for helping us when our daughter became quite ill they got us a doctor a cab to the hospital and made sure she was comfortable when she was released lastly the front desk arranged for a car service to take us over to cape liberty and pick us up upon our return from the cruise and take us to the airport we highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting first class service thanks casablanca we will return,Positive
there is probably nothing new i can offer the other reviews of this hotel already do a great job of summarizing what a wonderful hotel the casablanca is we stayed for nights sat wed we had booked a double room and did find that the bed was a bit small for us we are used to sleeping on a king at home but the room and bathroom itself were very nice on a special note the shower was fantastic spacious and great water pressure the hotel is very clean and quiet it is literally a few steps to time square and yet we did not hear any noise at night as many other reviews have noted the breakfast and winecheese cocktail are a special detail at the casablanca you can also get coffee cappuccino espresso tea etc all day the location is great because you can easily walk to several subway lines i would not hesitate to recommend the casablanca and hope to stay here again myself,Positive
well the positives it has a fantastic location you are right in the heart of manhattan just next to times square yet on a side road so a little out of the hustle and bustle the reception clerks were very friendly and helpful whenever we needed anything from them and the information they gave was always accurate the breakfast in ricks cafe is also superb it is a really nice touch to have a big lounge with free papers and internet access where you can get coffee and cookieshowever you really feel the need for the lounge as i think the rooms are so unimpressive we had a deluxe room and i really didnt understand how the standard rooms could be lower quality the furnishings are nice and the rooms are clean but they are soooo tiny once you had suitcases in there you were literally climbing over things to get around the bed same with the bathroom too it was a bit ridiculous really our tiny windown overlooked a fire escape so we had to have the air conditioning on but it was just so loud and clicked on and off every few minutes which woke me up quite a bitoverall i think it is a nice star hotel but if i went back i think id be inclined to stay somewhere fancier with bigger rooms,Positive
this is a really lovely hotel the staff are friendly and keen to help the rooms are small but well furnished and clean there is an ironing board which is always handy when youre travelling the breakfast was good and we really enjoyed the wine and cheese in the evening when we arrived back exhaused from sighseeing its also in a very good location as its in times square theres also some nice irish pubs a few streets away th i think and plenty of restaurants would definitely return to this hotel,Positive
had a lovely two night stay at the casablanca hotel in june couldnt believe how close we were to times square staff were very helpful and supplied fridge to our room to store my medicine without chargeroom was small but as they say who stays in their room in new york breakfast in hotel was a bonus and saved timerestuarants close by as you would expect and all main theatres within minutes walkwithout doubt we would stay here again,Positive
my wife yo daughter and i just completed a night stay at the casablanca i am not going to gush and say quotgreatest everquot or quotcant wait to returnquot but felt the hotel definitely met our needs it is clean quiet we were in room a jr suite at the back side of the hotel and comfortable please note other reviewers comments re noise at the front of the hotel housekeeping was excellent room always looked great when we returned daily please see other reviews re quotricksquot it was a nice extra there is a free computer with internet in ricks but i was able to use my laptop via a wireless network named quotcasablancaquot pros location was convenient and close to major subway stop ny port authority times square you can walk easily to the harbor cruises rock ctr empire st bldg central park etc times sq youre right there is very touristy and crowded but the hotel is just off the major crush of people and is like an oasis of calm room was not large but efficiently designed bathroom clean excellent water pressure in shower ac worked well but fan stays on continuously overhead room fans were also nice room had a safe lager enough to hold our small macbook laptop amazingly when i called the hotel the person told me their safes were too small to hold a laptop towels were adequate and were changed twice daily cons front desk folks were polite and pleasant but i did not find the restaurant suggestions to be that great they seem to quickly suggest the place next door tonys when there are tons of better places within easy walking distance i asked for a suggestion for a special place to take my wife for our anniv and never got an answer i was told they would send up a bottle of champagne which never arrived i would highly recommend buying a zagat restaurant guide a small paperback book it was spoton in its reviews and even categorized restaraunts by location eg w s cuisine view special occaision etc i felt that the front desk staff had basic knowledge and were decent with directions but they really arent by training or professsion a real concierge also bathroom lacked counter space although they had a small set of drawers to put things in neutral room furnishings and beds and linens were decent one flat screen tv and one reg tv in the suite variety of food wine cheese drinks at ricks was limited not a great variety as described by others and got old quickly for me nevertheless it was nice to have the option of having it free newspapers to read as well was a nice touch ok if youve read this far hotel has a very high percentage of european travelers likely word of mouth and strong euro and pound no one was unpleasant but our experience was that interaction conversation was very limited some reasonably based on language differences others seemed indifferent shy aloof i dont know i enjoy talking to other guests and this hotel was not positive for us in that regard take it for what its worth it was my disappointment and not an indictment of all european travelers overall the hotel met our needs but it is unlikely that i would stay again based on the huge variety of lodgings available in ny,Positive
our family enjoyed four wonderful days and nights at the casablanca first you cant beat the central location the hotel is small and quaint since it has less then rooms the staff gets to know you and is willing to assist in any way possible we traveled with our two boys aged and the casablanca met our families needs in so many ways a delightful continental breakfast every moning not only answered where to eat but also provided at least one nutritious meal for the day with cereal milk fresh fruit and yogurt we could stop in any time throughout the day and get water tea coffee and cookies for the boys in the evening my husband and i really enjoyed the wine and cheese reception we got to visit with other guests and compare travel tips when we left the staff even packed a big cup of cookies for each boy for the train ride we were treat like family by the entire staff and cant wait to go back to our quotnyc homequot,Positive
the hotel was all we expected from the tripadvisor reviews a quiet place close to the madness of times square the cafe ricks provides a relaxed homey feel and the free wine and cheese reception in the evenings except sunday is a great way to unwind after a day of sightseeing the staff is outstanding and made us genuinely feel like guests in their home,Positive
we stayed at the blue moon hotel during november and had a great timethe hotel is lovely with little bits of history all over the placeour room was lovely and with plenty of room it also had a small balcony over looking the williamsburg bridge the bed was firm ensuring a great nights sleep the bathroom was well appointed but you had to flush the toilet a few times for it to clear the shower was powerful but the towels for drying yourself were on the small sidethe front of house guy who we met on our first day paul was fantastic so friendly and full of information he really made a difference to our staywe would definitely stay there again the hotel is in a great location for getting around new york and the neighbour hood has some lovely restaurants in strolling distance,Positive
from the moment we walked in we were greeted by a warm and friendly atmosphere fresh coffee was available staff andy anotella and kathleen in particular couldnt have been more helpful and welcoming their presence improved our stay the rooms were spacious and comfortable the bathrooms had fresh towels everyday if wanted free wifi available in all rooms a good choice of bagels and pastrys for breakfast even though they were served on plastic plates little things like being able to order a takeaway to be eaten in our room after checking out still offered us a place to leave our luggage whilst we did last minute shopping and coffee while we waited for our taxi the hotel is located right by many places to eat and drink the subway is round the corner and broadway and soho can be reached by foot all in all this hotel is an excellent place to stay for a great trip to new york,Positive

stayed at blue moon over thanksgiving weekend this boutique style hotel is close to subways and lots of trendy bars and restaurants this lovingly restored tenement building has unique rooms named after old movie stars the staff were helpful and special mention must go to bryan who was always willing to go the extra mile day and night would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something dfferent than the range of chain hotels that you ca get in new york,Positive
it is definitely not the same old same old the hotel is uncommonly charming something over which the proprietor is rightfully proud and will stand in the lobby and chat with you about at your leisure larry concierge extraordinaire is on hand at seemingly all hours to meet every need good food is abundant in the neighborhood it was a delightful experience one that i wouldnt hesitate to repeat or to recommend,Positive
the hotel was very clean and the decor was excellent larry worked the desk for the three days we were there and really added to our experience there friendly helpful and a great person to have around he really is an asset to the hotel,Positive
we loved this quaint little historic hotel so much our first visit last year that we decided to splurge on the penthouse suite and come back again this year unfortunately the elevator was out the first day of our stay and we had to hike up and down flights of stairs the room ac did not function very well on a sunny day in this large room on top floor and the whirlpool tub ceased working the second day all in all we still had a good time and larry on their staff was very informative and accommodating as always,Positive
on the train home right now blue moon hotel will be the only place we stay from now on the hospitality was one of the best experiences we have had bar none in the nyc hotelsbampbs and we have stayed hundreds of different places over the last years or so larry was on duty the entire weekend and above and beyond helpful and friendly we had a visit from a friend who was definitely impressed and will be recommending to anyone coming to visit him the rooms were the largest i have stayed in the decor thru out the hotel was just gorgeous from the original art work done by the owner to the vintage pieces found onsite during renovation the les tenement museum is next door although we didnt partake we will next time we did make a few book purchases at the museum store locally there is really everything you need in walking distance we had to go midtown for a show on friday but didnt leave the les the rest of the weekend cananis restaurant around on ludlow and the barrio chino for lunch were great about a minute walk to little italy and the shops on broadway about another this may have been my first quotrelaxingquot weekend in nyc ever thanks so much larry we really appreciate the effort and kindness we will be back asap and try out another room,Positive
blue moon hotel was just what we were looking for to celebrate a californians th bday the accomodations were perfect the ambiance was flawless the staff was amazing andy amp francesca were great to us we had such a great time that we are planning another th bday visit september,Positive
my wife and i recently had the blue moon experience which was really fantastic we stayed at this small hotel tucked away in the lower east side of new york city it gives a real taste of the city not the kind of hotel that could be picked up and placed in any city in the world it really had everything we wanted and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate the guests the facilities were clean the furnishings comfortable the ambiance was friendly and warm the service was truly great its one of those places that when you leave you realize how much you really enjoyed it and you know you will return meyer and hana,Positive
preservationists will love this place the owner has assembled an unbelievable collection of real history which is woven into the decor of the building the wwii era and yiddish theatre posters really bring you back to the good old days talking to him is a history lesson in and of itself he has a real passion for what he has accomplished,Positive
our stay in the blue moon was a last minute booking we were coming to ny to get married and had booked in to a very hip and expensive hotel further uptown for days of our stay we were supposed to be staying with a friend the rest of the time but this fell through so the blue moon chosen after a rushed flick through a guide book and what a brilliantly happy impulsive choice to make we loved everything about it the rooms are very spacious and comfortable the downtown location is great for more bohemian bars restaurant and retro shops a great area for wandering around but more than anything this hotel has soul clearly the owners have taken great pride in refurbishing this old tenement block taking great care to retain as many original features as possible and displaying old relics from former inhabitants sure it might not be for those who like a bit more bling but you know what when a proprietor takes this much care with a building and its history then you know you are dealing with deeply respectful people of integrity and you can be sure that you will be treated well i was very sad to leave the blue moon and although our posh hotel was very pretty and glamorous it had no heart i would come back to this hotel in a second my deepest respect and thanks to the owner and staff for creating this little gem in downtown ny,Positive
from the time i walked in i felt it was going to be a good stay and it was the people are very nice always at your service hotel is stunning and it is in a great spot in the lower east side you cant ask for more very neat clean annd friendly i would forsure stay there again thanks blue moon,Positive
as soon as we walked into the lobby we fell in love with the place lovely decorations and a feeling of the past surrounds you we stayed in the jimmy durante room clean cozy and fresh the owner and staff were very friendly and they made our stay even more enjoyable,Positive
this was our second visit to nyc the first time we stayed up near the th avenue attractions but this time we wanted to explore the history of new york and the areas in the lower side of the city the blue moon hotel is in the best situation to explore the areas of lower east side soho little italy and chinatown all of which are within an easy walk away in sensible shoes there are also loads of really good restaurants within walking distance for advice speak to larry see below the subway is nearby too for venturing further afield a visit to the tenement museum next door is a mustthe hotel itself is a relaxed and comfortable place to be in such a busy city the rooms are much larger than most nyc hotels and they are very clean and wellequipped the bathrooms are spotlessly clean breakfast is exactly as advertised bagels fresh orange juice and real italian coffee small pastries and a fruit bowl we found this to be more than adequate and ended up sharing a bagel as they are so filling our host randy was warm and friendly and larry antoinella and the other staff were exceptionally helpful and great fun to chat to at the beginning and end of each day we are already recommending this hotel to our friends back home and we will definitely stay here again on our next visit,Positive
it was a great experience would definitely stay here again and again my family recently stayed at the blue moon hotel in manhattans lower east side the experience was lovely in every way in fact it was not the first time for us but this time i even took along my brother and some friends the rooms are large luxurious and very comfortable the bathroom sparkles and while in the oldest district of manhattan has all the modern amenities you want the hotel is green so you can relax they use only organic cleaning products the linens and towels were always fresh and soft the owner mr brandisini personally welcomed us and insisted we take pastries up for the kids the hotel serves breakfast each morning and while i didnt go down myself my sixyearold daughter didfor me as a ny history lover i felt like i walked back in time and lived it through the decor the atmosphere were amazingwas the best experience in a nyc hotel we ever had,Positive
booked this trip for a special occasion and what a gem of an experience the staff and owner were all so friendly informative and helpful nothing was too much trouble the decor of hotel and rooms takes you back in time interesting new york artifactsmosaic tiling colorful paintings location would not be for everyone but we like exploring and every where was easy to get to,Positive
the hotel was beautifully restored to a warmth andcharm seldom found in new york we had one of the smallest rooms and it was huge by ny standards the best part was the service everyone made us feel like we were old friends larry helped us find just the right restaurants shops and quotinquot nightlife the lower east side is a hidden jewel in nyc great boutiques and restaurants that are easy on the pocketbook we will definitley return to the blue moon,Positive
i highly recommend this hotel we found the place by chance and we were so happy to have stayed there,Positive
wonderful rooms great service and reasonable prices we wont stay anywhere else in nyc larry steve and antoinella make you feel like youre home,Positive
this is a quaint boutique hotel with large rooms that are quiet excellent service by the owners and staff the hotel is excellently decorated with a lovely lobby elevator and halls the size of the rooms are very large and comfortable compared to anything comparable in new york city excellent for a busy business trip or a lovely romantic getaway,Positive
blue moon is a former tenement building in the lower east side thats been converted into a luxury inntype hotel through the work of a dedicated proprietor the style is esoteric and very nonnew york and includes touches from the original turn of the century building we stayed in the eddie cantor room which is a quintessential on the top floor with a small balcony the room was more than big enough and comfortably appointed but the real charm is the addition of artifacts from the original tenement that were put into collages by the proprietor bottom line great quiet off the beaten path romantic hotel,Positive
beautiful roomscharming ambiencefeels like the old lower east sidevery helpful staffonly downside is we did not want to leave the hotel,Positive
i stayed at the blue moon hotel downtown on orchard street with my girlfriend on valentines day this year we had a fantastic time the hotel is hidden in a great neighborhood full of awesome places to eat brunch the hotel is historic but romantic and very cozy as well the hotel staff headed by a very affable and informative man named larry greeted us and cordially helped us throughout our stay the room was fantastic with a beautiful balcony clean bathroom confortable bed and very spacious i highly reccommend this hotel for couples andor anyone who wants to stay in nyc but away from upmidtown and close to bk awesome location,Positive

blue moon ranks at the top of all my travel experiences and im a frugal welltraveled picky person i am a selfemployed writer and every travel dollar has to be well spent because i dont have an expense account but i like to treat myself well and feel safe while experiencing whatever city i am in blue moon met all my requirements provided me with many special surprises im a hitchcock fan and larry recommended a rarely seen film from their freerental video collection when i visit nyc which is about once a quarter i have to have a good bagel and the breakfast served downstairs every morning were some of the best bagels ive ever had and even though i missed having whitefish salad im glad they didnt have the smelly stuff in their lobby and the coffee was delicious even though there was a starbucks across the street i felt no need to leave the hotel the room was huge in nyc standards ive stayed in many very nice hotels in the city from the upper west side to park central i have never had a room this comfortable with a balcony and city view from my window for this comparable price when i arrived i received elegant care from all the employees each one had their specialty from sharing the history of the building to dvd recommendations to restaurant recommendations i came and went several times throughout the day and into the wee hours of the night and yet whenever i arrived i was always greeted like i was a family member i just realized i probably should have been a better tipper but i honestly felt so much like i was in a house full of my family that it didnt even occur to me my bad i hope theyll forgive me but i guess thats another signthat i never felt like anyone was doing anything for any other reason than they all just loved their quothomequot and wanted to make me feel comfortable larry did say he was from the south so perhaps his innate sense of hospitality just came with ease but that doesnt explain the rest of the staffbesides the fabulous treatment the rooms and lobby and particulars are all meticulously renovated in keeping with the s or earlier i may have the date wrong history of the building everything is very modern and wellequipped i heard richard price the author stayed there for months while looking for an apartment if my fantasy of having a pied a terre in nyc ever comes true ill be living in the blue moon hotel and taking my time picking out a residenceblocks to chinatown and little italy and soho its the perfect location if you need to be somewhere faster than the subway or your feet can carry you the staff will call a car service for you in seconds no more pricey than a taxi and also very nice drivers i could gush more but i think the truth is in the fact that i already know where i will be staying when i return in july and oct and next january,Positive
what a fabulous surprise the blue moon hotel is its tucked away in the lower east side with no big flash frontage but the minute you step inside the cheerful lobby you feel as if youve been one of the family for evercoffee tea and a glass of wine are on offer as a welcome everyone who worked there went out of their way to help with advice restaurant recommendations information about the area and background to the historic aspects of the building there is a great sense of respect and admiration for the history of the area amongst the people who work at the blue moon and they love sharing this information with those who have an interestthe rooms are decorated in the period of the actors they are named after and each has its own distinct character rooms are well fitted out and have practical and aesthetically pleasing furniture which make them feel like a home from home great coffee supplied for the coffee makers in the room and a well appointed bathroom make the blue moon a very comfortable place to stayi would happily go back next time i visit new york city,Positive
the blue moon is a wonderful gem of a hotelcomfortable ideally situated in manhattan and with a classy artistic charm the furnishing were all new the rooms nearly soundproof and the staff gracious and solicitous almost to a fault the tastefully unified dcor celebrates the history of the building the neighborhood and the stars of the early nyc theater the location was perfect for our purposes near chinatown and little italy in the prime historic territory for tracing our ancestral roots even better than the facilities though were the people our family of two grownups and two teenage girls came from orlando in december but were faced with what could have been a vacation from hell due to luggage that was not just misrouted but totally lost the blue moon staff thankfully was tremendously helpful in easing our problems even going so far as to lend me a topcoat so that we could buy clothing rather than having to face the nyc weather in our orlando shortsleeves we had packed our heavy coats in our luggage they eagerly provided wellinformed histories of the area the locations of excellent restaurants of all flavors and suggested sites to visit with simple directions in all we cannot say enough positive about the hotel and above all its people you cannot go wrong by staying at the blue moon,Positive
my family went to nyc for a rare weekend getaway this past augustwe went to the blue moon in the lower east side what a trip to my youth the hotel is a living museum the entire place was painstakingly and lovingly restored art adorns every wall along with collages of actual newsprint and memorabilia the lobby is so quaint and fun each room carries the name of the stars that i grew up with molly piconjack benny sid ceaseri found myself smiling and enjoying the atmosphere the rooms were well appointedwith a well stocked fridgeand coffeemaker marvelous mattresses indiv air conditioning controls a dvd player and a t v the lobby had a lending library of things to watch breakfast was informal as soon as we went downstairs a fresh pot of coffee was prepared the bagels and danishes were fresh and deliciousthe entire family had a great time and everyone wants to go back againwe brought a car but it is closely situated near many trains and its easy to get around the city from there,Positive
i am an authorlecturer with a very busy travel schedule all over the united states the business that invited me to lecture in new york city booked the hotel for me as usual but this time i was pleasantly surprised with a new and unique hotel the blue moon hotel in manhattan new york i was there for one night only but they were very kind to letting me check in early since the room was ready it had an atmosphere of artistic elegance but not pretentious and very comfortable there was clear attention to detail which i did not find in other ny hotels the owners and staff were extremely kind welcoming and helpful i am looking forward to staying there again,Positive
i did a lastminute business trip to ny last time i stayed at the rivington down the road but fancied staying at the blue moon as the reviews seemed positive and i liked that it apparently had characterthe price was exactly the same as the rivington at already an eyewatering new york pricemy complaint is that i expect a seriously upmarket hotel experience for that amount of money i travel a lot with work even in new york rooms were fine nice even with some careful furnishing with special attendence to the restoration of an old tenement property but nothing speciali was already thinking this was way overpriced when i went down to breakfast lovely fresh bagels but served in the lobby with cream cheese from a packet on plastic plates with plastic knives and forks and coffee in a cardboard cup coffee was also allowed to sit for too long as i discovered on the first day urgh for i expect to at least eat off china not airplane plastic also no kitchen so impossible to order anything hot or even a capuccino i complained to the manager who was perfectly nice and actually quite upset who said that he very rarely got complaints only from europeans i had to reschedule my breakfast meetings to the rivington where they have a fantastic breakfast room and serve scrambled eggs also he said that rooms were smaller at the rivington but actually that was not my experienceif this hotel was i would warmly recommend it but for i cant its little more than an upmarket bampb,Positive
great place the location is the draw but the hotel was charming and cosy,Positive
we were absolutely delighted by the charm of the parlor the decor of the room and the genuine friendliness of larry and andy i have not stopped raving to everyone i know about the blue moon hotel without hesitation there is no other hotel wed stay in while in nyc during future visits thanks to all there for an incredible experience,Positive
my husband yearold son and i stayed at the blue moon hotel for two nights after christmasi hadnt been in downtown nyc since i worked there nearly years ago the blue moon hotel was the perfect location to revisit the area and show our son why we love it so muchupon our arrival larry greeted us warmly and offered us a complimentary glass of wine we stayed in the louis armstrong room it overlooks orchard street and we loved being able to observe the activity below it really made us feel like a part of the neighborhood not just visitors the room was very comfortable and clean larry is a wealth of information whether it be providing directions or detailing the history and renovation of this spectacular property one truly senses what a labor of love the blue moon is for everyone from the owner randy to larry bryan and housekeeping bryan who also works at the front desk is pleasant and very helpful as wellrandy gave us a wonderful restaurant recommendation tre which is a lovely little italian place on ludlow he even went ahead and phoned them to let us know we were coming as a result the restaurant gave us a complimentary desserta fantastic zepoli with a sinfully delicious cannoli fillingmy son is gaining an interest in photographing cityscapes we had intended to go up to top of the rock that evening and told him so however the fog made a visit to totr impossible randy graciously allowed us to enter the beautiful eddie cantor room so our son could take photos from the spectacular outdoor balconyblue moon hotel is a very warm comfortable and welcoming place to explore the lower east side the staff is very friendly and bends over backwards to ensure that your stay is exceptional whats more the hotel and its location offer convenience to all the sites and even better a real feel for what it is like to live in the area we are already planning a return trip in the spring we cant wait to go back and wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for those seeking great service and a true new york experience,Positive
my fiance and i spent nights at the blue moon manhattan in december its location in lr east side is some way from the main tourist areas of manhattan but the subway service both uptown and downtown was very good the area in some ways represents more authentic new york than much of midtown manhattan hotels are very expensive but this was better than most worked out at per night including tax this was their most basic level of room but still very spacious with a good size balconybreakfast was provided free unusual in manhattan though they do not have a restaurant for lunch or dinner its a small hotel with just rooms the upper level ones are fabulous with brilliant views but quite a lot more expensive the managers are delightful nothing was too much trouble and we got complimentary wine on arrival the place had a great feel to it and we will certainly stay there next time we go to new york,Positive
we passed this hotel by chance last year while exploring the lower east side and were intrigued by its charm and character on this visit we stayed here for nights and it fully lived up to our expectationsthis converted tenement is obviously a labour of love for the owner whose meticulous attention to detail can be seen in every part of the hotel the design of the spacious room was in keeping with the concept of the building past and presentstaff were extremely friendly and helpful especially larry and antonella both a source of invaluable knowledge on the history of the hotel and surrounding areawe specifically wanted to stay in a downtown hotel to escape the usual midtown locations preferring the feel of les and the village etc however you can quickly reach any part of the city from here as there are a few subway stops close to the hotel the easiest being the f train from delanceywould definitely stay here again and have no hesitation recommending the blue moon hotel for anyone planning to visit the staple nyc landmarks or those looking to experience manhattan from a different perspective,Positive
why stay anywhere else i found this little gem by chance back in nov and i was immediately impressed the blue moon hotel is like no other hotel in nyc from the location dcor history to the cleanliness and superb staff this is a must stay oh let me not forget to mention the great price for a room that is huge this is not one of those places that only posts pictures of the biggest and nicest rooms on their website all the rooms look like that i just stayed there for the third time a few weeks ago coming from washington dc i was greeted by larry and a glass of wine who is not only a perfect gentleman put a great resource he should write a book on customer service he is truly and asset at the hotel and i thank him for the great service and awesome dinner suggestions the night i arrived i ran into randy the owner to my surprise he remembered me and welcomed me back then he said he was going to check on upgrading my room for the following night the next day we got back from touring around to find they put us in the penthouse eddie cantor room words really cant describe this room and the view i could write and write about this place but you will just have to stay there for yourself let me just say if you want to get a true sense for this great city this is the place to go the nightlife is energetic neighborhood like and very safe and the service makes me think of what it must have been like in and what my parents would refer to as the good ole days,Positive
we didnt know too much about this place before booking but were delighted when we stayed there its stylish charming and quirky and even the lower grade room we had booked turned out to be spacious and well equipped activity bustles in the lobby which also serves as the breakfast area take a window seat and soak up the atmosphere with a very generous continental breakfast manager larry couldnt have been more helpful he provided us with info and maps for getting about and took the trouble to walk us part way to a restaurant that he recommended close by one among a number of very understatedly fashionable bistros and bars in this areawell definately return to the blue moon with the dollarpound exchange rate its not a cheap option for brits at the moment but on leaving we were promised a great discount on our next trip theremark amp juliette,Positive
we took a chance and stayed here last weekend due to the proximity to my daughters apartment a block away and im glad we did we arrived at am which was well before the normal check in but no problem with larry at the front desk larry looked after us throughout our two night stay and was more than happy to tell the history of the hotel and surrounding area this is a small property with larger than norm room size for a hotel of this type in new york decor was in keeping with the lower east side tenement district which made for some intersesting and pleasing viewing if you like real deli bagels and pastry you will really appreciate whats put out for breakfast each morning all fresh and local the hotel is very clean and we found the entire staff to be friendly and supportive we had them call us a car to jfk and am pleased to report no upcharge for this service this was our fourth stay in new york in the last months all of our previous visits were spent in midtown which is about blocks away i liked the location of the blue moon more of a neighborhood feel versus the touristy midtown,Positive
after staying at this hotel i must say that it was of the most pleasant and comfortable experiences ive had i was very impressed by the large size of the room that i stayed in and the warmth and pleasantness of the service everything in the hotel is bursting with character from the colorful art pieces and fascinating artifacts from the late s most importantly it was a comfortable and unique experience one that i would very much like to have again,Positive
i travel frequently for business and this time it was new york i was very pleased with the beautifully decorated room the relaxed atmosphere and the very helpful staffso much better then these hotel chains it was a memorable place to stay and i will definitely revisit when im back in new york,Positive
we stayed at the blue moon hotel in new yorks lower east side for five nights from the stth october to celebrate our second wedding anniversary we wanted something different and we certainly found it at the blue moonthe hotel is a converted tenement building and the decor of the hotel is very inkeeping with the era it has tried to recreate sometimes you feel that you are staying in more of a museum than a hotel original artefacts adorn the walls and the lobby and the rooms are fantastic in that respect lots of characterful wood tasteful traditional decor great character bathroom very comfy bed etc etcwe booked a cozy room which has a small balcony but despite the name we were thrilled to find a large room oozing character all of the rooms are named after local lower east side celebrities we were in the jimmy durante room whereas most ny hotel rooms are no bigger than the proverbial shoe box this hotel boasts to have some of the biggest rooms in new york and i can believe thatthe hotel offers a complimentary continental breakfast in the lobby and this was a great way to start the day again many ny hotels are room only so this was another quirk we enjoyed a leisurely coffee and bagel whilst watching the locals of the area going about their morning business outside the hotelwe found a complimentary bottle of wine in our room with a card wishing us a happy anniversary which was a lovely touch the staff at the hotel are all very friendly and will help you with any queries you may havethe best thing about this hotel however is its location the lower east side is buzzing with character as well as lots of lovely restaurants and bars to spend pleasant evenings the shops are really unique guss pickles less than a block away and the whole area is fantastic for peoplewatching this was our first visit to ny and we spent all day every day walking and sightseeing all over manhattan so it was very refreshing to come back to a locals neighbourhood and just fit in with everyone else geographically its also an ideal base from which to head downtown into the financial district uptown to the main tourist attractions of midtown or our favourite places across town to the fantastic areas of soho greenwich village chelsea east village etc etcwe had a fantastic but tiring time so the blue moon and the lower east side really felt like a homefromhome for us during our stay you certainly feel that you are in new york not some faceless hotel where really you could be anywhere in the world if you are a likeminded traveller who loves the quirks of life rather than someone who is only impressed by the big smoke then you will love the blue moon and all it has to offer as we did,Positive
i stumbled onto this hotel through orbitz and had to check it out on ta i am not sure how anyone could not be pleased with quality of the room and the phenominal staff yes it is a little bit off the beaten path but what a wonderful experience it was to stay in this unique property having traveled extensively on business and leisure to find a property in nyc with this level of service and its large and very confortable rooms was a real surprise this is not to say it is a bargain as to price but it is average for new york city after all the city itself is expensive i would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys small botique hotels in the middle of a city neighborhood with lots going on day and night yes i did see on ta a few folks who were very irate about their stay and treatment but you cant please everyone everytime i will defitinitely be staying there the next time i have to go to ny an be downtownand have already told others about the property dfn from stl,Positive
great stay everything was great especially antonella who recommended a great italian restaurant our bathroom had a view of the empire state building and was very roomy this hotel is extremely clean and very quiet i would definitely stay here again,Positive
we reserved at the blue moon knowing little about it and what a wonderful surprise we got the hotel was adorable immaculate and warm the staff was first rate and friendly and our room was perfectwe heartily recommend the blue moon for anyone and everyone looking for a charming european style hotel experience in a hip up amp coming new york neighborhood,Positive
i spent my wedding night and a day at the blue moon hotel in new york city i had heard that it was a comfortable and friendly hotel it was much more than that when i made my reservation i had explained that it would be my first night with my bride we arrived close to am and the owner himself greeted us we were treated like royalty the staff made themselves available at a moments notice the first thing i noticed was the view of the manhattan skyline we ordered room service and we were attended to very quickly the beds were very comfortable the room and the bathroom was impeccably clean the next morning a wonderful typical new york breakfast was offered with an open hand we came down late as can be expected the night after a wedding and the variety and freshness of the food was a pleasant suprisethe owner joked with us and made small talk and really made us feel like we were with family the staff was so warm and friendly i couldnt believe i was in new york cityover the years i had heard of new yorks lower east side i am a terrible shopper and even i loved going to all the stores in the neighborhhood we went to the tenement museum and were very touched by the stories and history then we went out for lunch also a plethora of choices greeted us we then visited a couple of art galeries did some more shopping in chinatown which is really closeby the whole area is so historic and so alive we were both exhausted when we got back to the blue moon hotel exhausted but happy i cant write enough of how wonderful our stay was and of the staff of the blue moon hotel i look forward to going back there on my next trip to nyc who doesnt like being spoiled after all,Positive
culture art and history all in one place largest room i had in ny great service close to seaport soho tribeca east village and greenwich village i walked everywhere i recommed it highly,Positive
i was excited to book a room at this hotel for my husbands birthday i booked a mid priced room which was for one night expecting that the ammenities would match the price tag i also asked that since it was a special occasion i would appreciate getting the cutest room they had at that price range i have stayed in many fine boutique hotels and have always been given the best room available even if was above the range of the room paid for i asked if the hotel was sold out and it was not but we just got a run of house room anyway wellhonestly the room was just ok the bed was not comfortable there were no nice little extra touches the lighting in the room was bad in the morning ii just wanted to pack and leave as quickly as possible the staff was very nice and friendly but the breakfast was just bagels and fruit and a few pastries really inadequate for the price tag it should have been much nicer i will not book here again i wanted to really love it,Positive
my wife and i stayed at the blue moon in june for days travelling from australia this was our third trip to new york in the last years after reviewing the fantastic feedback on ta i was enthusiastic about staying there we found the room sizes excellent and the staff extremely friendly and accomodating the theme of the hotel however i believe it is movie stars of the s leaves a little to be desired the breakfast whilst very fresh was a disappointment with simply bagels pastries and some pieces of fruit i did not feel that this hotel was great value for money and would not stay there again in the future,Positive
we had nights in this hotel larry and antonella are a credit to the hotel they provided great service and hospitality they were a wealth of information and were so personable and friendlyhotel is a couple blocks from a subway stop and is ideally situated for sightseeingthe view from the room was incrediblefree internet access is provided in the lobby,Positive
after popping in to see the charming lobby while wandering orchard street on a previous visit to nyc about months spent a nite in this little gem last week and found it a wonderful experience my room the milton berle was on the funky side of quotdeluxequot but authentic roomy and homey made up for it the staff were terrific especially antonella a most personal and helpful concierges larry whose enthusiam for the history and the artifacts makes staying there feel like a privelege i had the sense of setting up a temporary quothomequot there in a way ive only experienced at bampbs and never in the new york area,Positive
we wantied to experience another part of the city and this is a great place to feel more like a local than a tourist antonella and larry aretwo of the best desk clerksconcierge in town so helpful with directions and great suggestions on dining the views on the th floor and above seem to be the best very relaxing and cozy feel to the hotel nicely located to subway stops and easy cab ride to entire downtown area,Positive
loved the location lower east side blew us away very up amp coming social scene the hotel is right next to the subway for a quick ride uptown the rooms were extremely large for new york standards and also very clean the atmosphere despite reviews to the contrary was extremely quiet and tranquil the bagels in the morning were delicious the staffs service was truly impeccable larry andy antonella and randy were all excellent hosts more than anything they want you to have the best time possible they are full of great recommendations and always go above and beyond your expectations the only possible suggestion concerns the beds which were a bit hard would highly recommend made a perfect romantic getaway,Positive
the blue moon hotel is a quaint hotel in a great location it is close to chinatown little italy and a resonalbe cab fare to time square we had some difficulty with the air conditioning but the kindness caring and respect received from the manager and staff was overwhelming they fixed the problem but continued to check that we were okay their advice was always available and they tried hard to please the customer it was a breath of fresh air to have personable care in new york city,Positive
first the good the hotel is very pretty with a period theme and nicely situated on the edge of chinatown and within walking distance of little italy and the east village the staff was very attentive and my stay was very pleasant continental breakfast was enjoyable and the overall atmosphere was very positive now the bad i travelled on business and booked the hotel for myself and two other guests in separate rooms based on the somewhat affordable room rates night while we were told that cancellation of our reservation must be made hours in advance we were not notified that if our stays ended early that we would be charged of the room rentals for the remaining nights consequently when our business concluded early we were forced to pay an amount roughty more than what the cost of the stay should have been this has not been our experience with large ny hotels that host business travellers the manager who was very nice up to that point refused to compromise and it is unlikely that we will stay at the hotel again or recommend it to other travelers in fact given the personal attention of the managerowner based upon this review we will probably not be invited back to the hotel,Positive
i stayed in the quotburns and allenquot room for a week in late july and every single aspect of the hotel and the service exceeded expectation the room was amazingly spacious comfortable and appealingly designed the staff were wonderful and all in all it was great value the lower east side neighborhood in which the blue moon is located is my favorite part of manhattan tourists planning to visit nyc shouldnt be put off by the idea that its not quotcentralquot as in fact its right next to other great areas like soho and the village and so much more fun and more peaceful than staying in faceless polluted midtown i will be recommending this hotel to everyone i know,Positive
wonderful hotel full of character and cozy friendly competent staff quietthe only negative thing i found was that breakfast was served on disposable plate and quotsilverwarequot was plastic,Positive
we stayed in the blue moon during the first week of august and enjoyed the stay the rooms were tastefully decorated and bigger than what we expected for manhattan the noise level wasnt very high even though our room faced the street the staff was very friendly and helpful and the owner himself came over and talked to us we will definitely stay there again if we are in the area,Positive
funky hotel wonderful location in lower east side quiet street just off delancey fabulous price for nyc very friendly staff delicious bagels for breakfast oldfashioned rooms with modern bathrooms would definitely stay here again,Positive
what a wonderful hotel my husband and i stayed at the blue moon hotel recently and were extremely impressed with how historic pristine and authentic everything was the furnishings were antique and we were shown how the owners restored so much of this historic time period in new york that it is truly more than just a regular hotel staywhen we first walked into the lobby and were greeted it felt like we were transported back in time with the music and restored furnishing the room we stayed in was a deluxe and everything was perfect right down to the antique furnishing and the lcd tv and mini fridge we couldnt even hear anything street noise the hotel is on orchard street which is a quiet street and right next door to the tenement museum there is a nice french cafe feeling in the lobby where breakfast is served in the morning fresh bakery goods bagels pastries oj coffee tea etcthere is so much to say about this hotel but all in all we will definitely be back and will recommend this hotel to friends visiting ny,Positive
my wife and i celebrated our th wedding anniversary at the blue moon hotel on the lower east side in new york city on june th we are from texas and our usual iteniary starts with a five star hotel in midtown this time we tried something different and im so glad we did the staff at this hotel was over the top friendly and made every effort to make our stay unique custom and first class we stayed in the eddie cantor suite which was spacious with a double door balcony with a great view of the lower east side and midtown the hotel quotartistquot gave us a tour of the various rooms and a history of the hotel and its remodel and local history the artist and the front desk person olga gave us great suggestions for restaurantsbarsshoppingand entertainment on the lower east side the coolest thing was when we could not get reservations the hotel staff made a call and got us in vip style they were also able to make car and transportation hookups for us each night when we go out olga or other staff members would call ahead for us arrange a car service and print us detailed maps this was on of the most unique and quotlocalquot experiences that we have ever had in new york for the first time we felt less like tourist and more like people from the neiborhood i cant say enough about blue moon but it is the staff that makes it a memory that we will never forget,Positive
stayed at the blue moon hotel for nights and loved it we had spent the nights before that in midtown at the royalton hotel truth be told the area that blue moon is in is much more local as compared to the area in midtown manhattan however the warmth and friendliness of the staff more than made up for it the rooms were very clean and very spacious the breakfast was superb local delights for the ny visitor to get an idea of the culture of the area bagels and rugelach from local bakeries dating back years old yummy they even doggy bagged ziplocked actually some for us to take with us for the day i would definitely stay there again especially now that we know the area better actually it is very close to the soho little italy chinatown area so that would be a plus for anyone wanting to spend more time in those areas compared to the cold and formal staff at other big hotels this was a lovely change especially when youre new to the city thank you blue moon for making the last days in ny the best of the whole trip,Positive
my stay at the blue moon was exceptional from the rooms to the staff it was definitely first class its not your average nyc hotel this place exudes charm so if youre looking for somewhere to stay in nyc whether its for a weekend or a week this is the place,Positive
i had the great fortune to stay at the blue moon hotel this week and found it a little jewelit is in the new hip area way downtown manhattan and it has such a charming atmospherethe staff randy andy larry were all fantastic and so welcoming i couldnt help but feel comfortable and relaxedthe hotel is restored and some beautiful features i stayed in the abbott and costello roomeverything was fresh and cleanthere is a cute lounge area in the front which hosted breakfast in the morning we also had all of the amentities of other hotels however they also allowed usage of dvd players in my room and had dvds for free in the lobbyi highly recommend the blue mooni plan to go back,Positive
great stay in nyc thanks to blue moon hotel with its very friendly staff fine rooms very quiet excellent location in downtown highly recommandable,Positive
the room was incredibly comfortable there was a lot of room so it felt more like a studio apartment than a hotel room the staff was very helpful they gave an excellent dinner recomendation and were just overall so nice and friendly,Positive
cozie amp charming this hotel welcomes new life to new york immediately upon entering into the lobby of this hotel you feel as though youve traveled somewhere far abroad plush beaded pillows give the couches a warmth amp comfort wonderful local artwork give the walls an inspirational glow amp a free glass of wine upon arrival make this a relaxing place to hang out the rooms put you at ease with their historical amp personal warmth beautiful faux painted walls with big nice iron beds fluffy pillows a beautiful bathroom amp lots of room to unwind like a french flat from a forgotten time the staff consists of all artists which gives this whole scene a bohochic appeal as well it sits in the heart of orchard street which is in the superluxhip lower east side seconds from some really groovy bars fantastic restaurants sinful shopping amp much more we heard that this was unlike any of the other hotels in new york but now we have seen it for ourselves and will return with pleasure hats off to olga who recommended quotjinquot a wonderful sushi restaurant to us she had several other yummy places but we didnt have enough time to wine amp dine ourselves at them all but another trip to the blue moon means more time to explore and adore,Positive
my family and i stayed at the blue moon hotel for the new year and being it was our first time in new york we was not sure what to expect as we had been told conflicting stories of hotels in new yorkto our surprise the hotel was very clean and tidy and the hotel staff could not be more helpfuland the room was spacious andtastefully restored to the theme of the hotel of the era it was builtwe enjoyed our stay very much and enjoyed talking to the ownerof the hotel and you could see the effort and care taken by the owner to restore this old tenament building into a very quaint and enjoyable place to staya very nice enjoyable stay and would definitively stay there again on our return to new yorkthanks the dennises,Positive

this was not my typical hotel choice manhattan hotels were especially pricey during this particular week so i chose blue moon because the rate was decent and it looked intriguingblue moon is great if you like boutique hotels off the beaten path with something unique to offeron the plus side rooms are a decent size by manhattan standards period details in the lobby and the room are nice the owner has embraced the cultural significance of orchard street and the lower east side also climate control is excellent i loved have a ceiling fan in the room amenities are very good good toiletries small but nice tv solid furnishingson the roomforimprovement side while the interior of the hotel was nice and quiet my room and that of a colleague faced orchard street and there was a pretty good amount of street noise sirens large trucks etc throughout the night i didnt get the best sleep as a result for a a night room i would also expect a slightly higher quality bed particularly the pillows and sheets the requirement to leave your room key at the front desk when you leave is a bit odd kind of hostellikeso on the whole an enjoyable stay but if you are a spaloving luxury hotel regular you might be better off with another choice,Positive
this was a last minute booking and we were more than pleasantly surprised we were greeted at checkin with a complimentary glass of wine and a very friendly and knowledgeable young lady we were given the ella fitzgerald room which was very nicely decorated and had a sitting area which was perfect for enjoying our glass of wine the bathroom was stocked with bath and body works products as well as two toothbrushes and a travel toothpaste my favorite touch it was quiet for sleeping and a continental breakfast was provided in the morning the only shortcoming we found and this is not under their control was that the parking garage that they validate for their guests was full and we needed to walk about blocks back from the one we tracked down a little farther away,Positive
just returned from a long weekend in new york where we stayed on the lower east side in this fantastic boutique hotel the hotel is a refurbished tenement house where the owner who was present and very friendly tried to preserve as much of the original details as possible marble floors original tenement doors tin ceilingsthe lobby is quaint and a tad quotshabbychicquot but our room was modern and clean we there were of us had the smallest room in the hotel and it was more than fine sizewise it even had more floor room than many standard rooms in chain hotels i would say and although our room was on the second floor at the front of the building it was very quietmy only criticism of the hotel would be the complementary breakfast served in the morning the coffee and oj are good but the bagels and pastries might have been fresher and of higher qualitythe hotel staff at the front desk were all very friendly especially andy who helped set up the coffee and pastries in the morningthe hotel is minute walk to soho and the east village and it is very close to a subway linei would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to anyone i encounter who is planning a trip to nyc,Positive
ah what a breath of fresh air it is to experience such an exquisite little gem that is blue moon hotel this was my nd visit and ill probably never stay anywhere else in the city and usually im a bit of a snob staying at the ritz or four seasons hotels of that caliber in my opinion though they pale in comparison to what youll be greeted with the second you pull up to blue moon it is on a quiet street on the lower east side in an area between china town and little italy it is out of the way of the more touristy areas of the city but to me worth every hair raising second in a cab to get there its in an historic little bldg inspired by hotels of yesteryear the proprietor randy is always in the lobby sitting at a cozy table waiting for guests to arrive and announcing you as you enter but not in a pretentious manner its done in a way of respect and honor that you have chosen his hotel to spend time inthe halls and rooms are decorated with collages of old postcards and artifacts that were found in the basement of the century year old hotel while it was being renovated each room is individually dedicated to stars of the s and s such as molly picon and mickey katz simply yet elegantly decorated they have the feel of ones found at fine bed and breakfast establishment and everything is so clean hard to find in any hotel let alone an older one in the cityrandy will enthusiastically tell you about the history of the premises he warmed my heart while telling us about his desire to preserve the soul of his building and you just know while listening to him that he truly means it the attention to detail and the friendly welcoming staff add to the ambiance fare from local vendors at the complimentary continental breakfast as well as being offered a nice glass of wine before retiring complete the journeyi reluctantly recommend this hotel only because selfish me doesnt want this little secret to get out and then have a hard time getting in on my next trip rest assured though randy told me to call him personally and hed find hook me up wow love him love this hotel,Positive
the blue moon hotel is a beautiful little boutique hotel nestled in the lower east side of manhattan a very exciting corner of the city the painstaking process that randy settinbrino went through to keep the spirit of the building alive is very obvious as soon as one enters the hotel with details from the former tenement flats utilised throughoutthe free wine upon arrival free internet acces free breakfast dvd library and special parking rates give an added value for no additional cost the room was very large and spacious and the bathroom comes with a huge bath not like the small baths typical of new york hotelsantonella and all the staff are extrememly helpful and willing to give you help and advice to make your stay in new york memorablefor those tourists visiting the city who think that midtown is the only area to be in i would advise you to consider the lower east side as there are many exciting bars restaurants and boutique shops with easy access to little italy chinatown the brooklyn bridge etc the hotel is just beside the subway too so youre not too far from the sights and sounds of the rest of the city,Positive
i stayed there with my children the room was very captivating it had old world charms named after a movie star with tenanent doors colorsof the walls were so pleasant and the room was very large overlooking the williamsburg bridge the service was friendly and engaging and the neighborhood a blast we loved it,Positive
wed stayed here before it was great then and has only improved the new complimentary glass of wine red for my husband white for me on our late arrival was deeply appreciated the hotel is clean painstakingly restored and well maintained the staff consistently helpful and charming clearly the operation is a labor of love our view of the williamsburg bridge from the balcony of our duke ellington cozy room was lovely and calming day and night its bathroom has a wonderful deep tub perfect after our long drive and busy new york day it even had a place to rest my arms while i read soaked and unwound not noisy at all in our room at the back note if you need to use the wifi computer connection call the desk to get the best access and codes we were able to logon both our laptops simultaneouslymy grandparents custommade clothing store womens cloaks amp suits had been just down the block at the corner of division st amp orchard so it was a short walk to see where it had been my mother and her sisters had lived on division ave in williamsburg just over the bridge also very close the hotel and its celebration of that era extended the feeling that i had come home and was still a part of the neighborhood despite never having lived there myself guests without such ties can visit the tenement museum next door to connect with the area and its historythe hotel does have a bit of a bampb quality watching the owners adorable young children leave for school in the morning chatting with staff and owner over a light breakfast so if you like an impersonal anonymous hotel this may not be your cup of tea though all were respectful of my husbands need for privacy we were in the lobby when a couple from ireland i believe whod been there for over a week came in and thanked randy effusively for his excellent suggestion for that nights dining and mentioned to us that all his recommendations had been wonderful treats the night manager was very helpful after i had booked online he made sure we were able to stay in the room wed loved during our previous visit and antonella an artist in her time off was as charming and helpful as shed been during our visit when i celebrated my birthday there well be backsura,Positive
after my husband had stayed at the hotel on a business trip he roccomended that i stay there when i came to manhatten to visit some friends and i was glad that i did the service was extraordinary the beds were comfortable and the size of the rooms are almost impossible to find in a hotel outside of ny much less in the city itself the staff was very helpful and friendly and the decor is a work of art in and of itself the owner of the blue moon has not just created a great hotel but rather a unique experience that the descerning customer can appreciate,Positive
this is the th time ive stayed at the blue moon the staff is friendly the owners thoughtful and very appreciative the rooms are spacious and immaculate in this era of boutique hotels with tiny overpriced rooms the blue moon is an oasisi highly recommend staying here the area is one of the most popular in the city with great restaurants shops all within walking distance wonderful value in a five star property,Positive
im a native new yorker now living in ohio stayed at this new hotel on manhattans trendy lower east side for nights staff was friendly helpful and knowledgeable about the area room was huge for the price with a view of historic orchard street off delancey everything was very clean and updated this is by far the warmest decor i have ever seen generous centuryold woodwork lovingly restored is everywhere the lobby is a visual feast leading immediately to a vibrant neighborhood teeming with contrasts of old and new interesting restaurants night spots bargains and trendy upscale shops a quick walk to little italy and chinatown when we were knocked out from shopping the hotel felt like our home with friendly help space to spread out great shower and firm comfortable beds this place is the best secret in nyc,Positive
i just stayed at the blue moon hotel this past weekend and had a really great experience i wrote up a similar review on yelpcom and here it is again blue moon hotel is a unique and quaint boutique hotel in the lower east side apparently its only a couple of years old so i guess the word hasnt really spread yet although the building itself was erected in the tenement museum is right next door so historical information about the area is easy to get blue moon hotel has spacious rooms friendly staff and a cute theme from the outside you may not know this is a boutique hotel the reception area looks like a quaint cafe we walked right by when we first got there there are rooms named after old movie stars some of which i recognized the hallways are decorated in old new york relics pictures from years past and salvaged ornaments of the original building strewn about we stayed in the james cagney room on the th floor overlooking the historic orchard street there are lots of cute restaurantscafes and boutique shopping on this street btw our room was the quotcomfortquot room that had an iron wrought queen size bed and a sofa bed our stay included complimentary continental breakfast and a gym pass to the ludlow fitness which we didnt get to take advantage of oh and they even set you up with toothbrushes and a travel size toothpaste its not perfect of course is there such thing the elevator is slow and we had to leave our keys at the front desk every time came and went which reminded us a bit of europe but this cute hotel has been written up in many travel mags as the quothidden gemquot of new york and national geographic did a special on blue moon hotel this month im glad we got to stay here a special thank you to olga and larry front desk staff who really helped us and made our stay super great,Positive
i travel a lot and usually prefer big hotels i made an exception for my most recent stay in manhattan and stayed at the completely charming blue moon hotel on the lower east side this hotel is spotlessly clean the rooms are large by nyc standards and very comfortable the staff is helpful and friendly we stayed in one of the smaller rooms and were very pleased but we noticed the large terraces of the upper floor suites from the outside so if you can afford it spring for one of those i have to say that my favorite thing was the old fashioned scheme of getting your key from the desk each time you return to your room it made me feel i was being looked after we returned to the hotel quite late each evening and believe me it was an oasis of warmth and light on a rainy ny night it was like stepping into a bygone day when hotels were family owned and the proprietor actually cared whether you enjoyed your stay when we first arrived an irish couple was leaving and said they wished they were staying longer because they loved the blue moon so much i felt exactly the same way its my new favorite nyc hotel,Positive
it says new yorks hidden jewel on the website and they werent lying after several nights here we were saying things like meet you back home at six this hotel is for people who are still interested in people i met so many lovely human beings from different places cultures and traditions in this hotel and it was an enlightening experience for an old cynic like myself the rooms are named for iconic movie stars and i think central casting may have had a hand in selecting the staff from the beautiful willowy receptionist olga always happy to keep those google map guides coming to larry the night manager with the gentle manner and the sympathetic ear from the passionate antonella with that amazing career path to the ever present and ever helpful manager randy he of the late night philosophy discussions this is not the hilton or the four seasons or any other brand it is uniquely honest and sincere and as with the best endeavours in life your willingness to contribute is rewarded enormously we are most grateful for having found our home in new york and look forward to seeing them all again just as soon as we can,Positive
this was the perfect hotel for me they have done a marvelous job with the building amazing details that make it charming located in a cozy neighborhood side streetthe salon type atmosphere at breakfast was nice too delicious ny bagels and coffee and you can visit with the other guests and read the morning papereveryone that works there is very kind and helpfulit just had such a nice welcome home feel after a day of running all over the city it was nice to get away from the sensory overload of manhattani highly recommend,Positive
this hotel is by far one of the most charming i have every stayed in step back into a place not only decorated with so much taste attention to detail and beauty but every room molding and picture frame tells a story from the lower east side of the past a charming escape from the busy new york city life just moments away from the village and all it has to offer the staff was wonderful very attentive kind and respectful i love that they had a selection of old dvds that could be watched on the player in our room the bed sheets were the nicest and cleanest smelling of any hotel ive ever been in as well and the free breakfast was a perfect touch huge room gorgeous balcony with quaint chairs and table all in all it was the perfect setting for a relaxing weekend of luxury,Positive
loved hotel and area much more fun than midtown very safe to stroll china town and little italy walkable to brooklyn bridge,Positive
we first booked another hotel in nyc the howard johnson that was so terrible as soon as we walked into the blue moon hotel we knew it was just perfect for us it was a quotgirlquot trip to nyc the of us just had a blast the rooms were unbelievable clean the beds were soo comfy bathrrom towels soft amp cozy the trundle bed was so fabulous im looking to purchase one just like it amazing views so much history in the lobby area and the staff excellent each morning we had fresh bagels and coffee in the lobby while chatting with the concierge and each evening we never went to our room wout hanging out in the lobby amp talking some more wthe concierge we even had the pleasure of meeting the owner amp his lovely family i have done a lot of traveling and stayed in several star hotels and this one is at the top of my list i would suggest it and will stay at the blue moon anytime i visit nyc,Positive
what a surprise to come to quotcoldquot new york city and be greeted with old world warmth and beauty in a lower east side location the wonderful quotblue moon hotelquot it sits in the middle of old new york with panoramic views of the whole city from the windows as it was in the s we had an upper floor room with large french doors and a balcony although it was january we could not resist standing on the balcony and viewing the city a great old new york view the rooms were larger than any othe new york hotel i have stayed in the staff especially the manager a tall bespeckaled literate poet greeted us as if we were family the lobby comes out of old paris or any other european cultural center the rooms are named for great theater and entertainment personalities of the past and there are many rare photographs to view in the lobby we could have spent our whole time in new york in the hotel and still felt we had an exceptional holiday the neighborhood is a history lesson with the warmth that we thought came with old world charm even if it was a myth this was the best hotel stay we have had in years go for it you will love the experience,Positive
the of us had great nights at the blue moon with a large room benny goodman and clean bathroom the quotbagel breakfastquot kept us going through the day the staff are all very friendly and helpful this is in contrast to the large ny hotels where no one is usually bothered about you our only negative comment would be the expensive price but then the blue moon is in new york it would be a good idea to hunt around for deals on the internet or maybe ring the hotel direct to see if they would make a competitive deal they discount by on repeat visits so they might be flexible if they are not already full we would happily return,Positive
really enjoyed staying in a hotel in the middle of the lower east side of new york the owners captured the essence of the history of the neighborhood with great collages and other era artwork and paraphernalia each room we were in sophie tucker had a unique design the staff was friendly and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable truly a gem,Positive
my daughter and i stayed at the blue moon for nights from march thth i wanted to try a different location then the usual and i made a great choice the staff was wonderful i had dealings with antonella larry and andy they all went out of their way to answer any questions give suggestions and be helpfuli loved my room although i had one of the least expensive room in the hotel it was beautiful very nice colors very homey it was the tommy dorsey roomi enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again,Positive
hotel is beautiful and the owners treat you like mom and dad there was a problem though with the reservation i reserved and confirmed two rooms online using the hotels web site but their system only booked one room the hotel was full and there was panic for a brief time but the owners worked quickly to arrange a room for my associate in a beautiful euro hotel two blocks away and even walked us over to book the other room my room at the blue moon was big and expertly restored to match the rest of the hotel this place is as much a work of art as it is a hotel and im sure it gets a lot of repeat business all in all a pleasant experience the glass of wine at check in is a very nice touch,Positive
writing this review at jfk airport wishing we had a few more nights at the blue moon this hotel is a beautifully and lovingly restored old tenement building which is such a refreshing change from the usual nyc hotel chains the staff are welcoming warm and only too pleased to help the rooms are a good size individual cosy comfortable and romantic although not placed in midtown manhattan there is a subway just around the corner which enables easy mins access to the mid town area more importantly the local area lower east side is vibrant at night with restaurants and bars including live music however the hotel is quiet and free from noise we travel all around the world and are fortunate to stay in top notch hotels but this little gem has soul character charm and warmth and we shall be recommending it to all our friends,Positive
i was looking for a hotel near bond street because of a show i had going up in a theatre there the blue moon was in an ideal location and turned out to be a wonderful experience i stayed in the george raft room and it was fine very clean and surprisingly roomy especially by manhattan standards the staff were extremely helpful and friendly i would definitely stay there again given the opportunity,Positive
if you are like me you probably use the internet to search options for hotels in the cities you visit on short notice i had to go to new york city but unfortunately it was fashion week reasonable rates were hard to find the only options seemed to be extremely pricey or those ultra small rooms i took a chance on the blue moon hotel and i was extremely pleased very clean hotel good sized rooms and excellent breakfast choicesfor your visit to the lower east side i think you will be very happy with this hotel selection,Positive
our family and i particularly travel a lot i am pretty demanding and dont mind paying top dollars for friendly service clean nice rooms i used to live on canal and ludlow and wanted to share the lower east side experience with my partner and children i was excited when i found blue moon on tripadvisor which i used for our monthlong trip to italy in boy was i disappointed its way too expensive for a soso experience we rented the quotquintessentialquot penthouse nice views large room but no shades on the top windown the jacuzzi did not work and was accused by the owner that quotyour family probably boke itquot why would we pay night and book your penthouse and break your jacuzzi how insulting restaurants nearby jin sticky rice were not very good nice try but missed cafe was fantastic for breakfast katz deli has meltinyourmouth pastrami fantastic chocolate egg cream and a super authentic new york experience a line for meat lunch for came to wownext time ill look at other places to stay nice idea no stars,Positive
this boutique hotel is a lovingly restored tenement building that retains its original character while offering the comfort of a highend hotel the management was warm welcoming and helpful pointing us to good local restaurants located next to the tenement museum the blue moon hotel is in a fascinating historic neighborhood we will definitely return,Positive
traveler from sweden with very high standards and her husband were more than pleased having travelled both in europe and the us we have plenty of hotel experience and we can honestly say that we never enjoyed a hotel this much before we spent a january weekend at blue moon hotel and it was a true delight it is quite a unique place full of charm and nostalgic new york atmosphere the gibson girls theater posters and s originals that decorate the walls the quaint lobby with antique objets trouvs and loads of embroidered pillows the consistent vintage americana flavor throughout all have tremendous appeal and did we mention that the staff was pleasant the room was comfortable the bathroom gleaming and every inch of the hotel absolutely spanking cleanas new york nostalgia buffs we gloried in our complimentary sunday morning coffee and bagels with cream cheese reclining on a window seat in the adorable lobby with frank sinatra and al jolson crooning softly in the background it doesnt get much better than thatwe also chatted a bit with the owner who lives on the premises with his young family he is an artist who did all the renovations and decorating himself and his creativity is apparent in every detail we wish them much success in the future because we will want to return again and again,Positive
this hotel was first class all the way everyone at the blue moon the owner and staff couldnt have been nicer and more pleasant they couldnt have been more accommodating and willing to go the extra mile for their guests the accommodations were utterly beautiful the food was absolutely fabulous i recommend this hotel very highly to anyone that needs a hotel on the lower east side,Positive
holiday season new york means streets full of shoppers who if they are visitors all seem to be staying in closetsized rooms in midtown hotels the blue moon and the lower east side is an escape from all thatwe stayed nights in the jimmy durante room sharing balcony at the rear of the building with sophie tucker the room not the lady ok so not a great plus in november but no doubt a bonus in the summer a huge room for your buck compared to other hotels in nyc with a very comfortable bed sufficient closet space and plenty of draw space everything in the room was clean and well cared for the hotel wifi worked well and the flat screen tv was a great improvement on the older tvs that most other hotels still provide kosher beigels and pastries in the lobby each morning complemented by fresh hot coffee were always a good way to start the day the hotel staff were very helpful and the offer of a glass of chilled wine at checkin was a welcome surprise in new york the opportunity to talk to the owner who lives in the property as he took his children and his two dogs to local school in the morning was a bonus he left the kids at school and brought the dogs back laterthe nearest subway station is a couple or three blocks away making travel to the rest of nyc very simple even for tourists brooklyn is just a few stops away so you can see first run movies for a ticket at the brooklyn academy of music bam rather than the charged to tourists in movie theaters around times square great places to eat nearby the noahs ark on grand street offers authentic deli food as does katzs on east houston further west along east houston is russ and daughters with the best selection of fresh cut herrings and smoked fish in new york and a newly opened wholefoods store if you want to buy in your own food guss on orchard street just across from the hotel or the pickle guys on essex street still sell pickles straight from the now plastic barrel with the offer of a taste before you buy tell me any food store that does that nowadays and a glut of chinese thai and vietnamese italian and american eateries everywhere else in the area with local people eating in themwe are back in new york next year our friends have asked us where we will be staying the blue moon of course,Positive
date stuart and julie on a th wedding anniversary the hotel is a converted tenement on the lower east side of manhatten many of the original features have been kept and some recreated the rooms vary in size but even the smallest is very spacious very clean and very comfortable the bathroom was perfectly adequate with a deep bath and shower the area was once dangerous for tourists but is now very safe with many varieties of bars and restuarants in the area the nearest subway station is approx yards away giving excellent access to all the cities attractions all in all an excellent place stay if you want to sample an alternative to the usual say in midtown,Positive
having recently recovered from breast cancer treatment i was looking forward to my roadtrip from mobile alabama to redding ct i picked up my best friend sue in baltimore and we drove from there to nycand the beautiful blue moon hotel the hotel has been exquisitely and lovingly renovated by the hotels owner randy sue and i both were very impressed with the pure cleanliness of the huge room and luxurious bath we were in the sophie tucker room all rooms are named after s amp s vaudeville stars and it was perfect for two friends the daybed was much more comfortable than a pull out sofa and with its high back and ends sue and i both felt like we had our own space and privacy when it was time to go to bedthe people who work at the blue moon were wonderfully sweet and helpful in fact it was my initial phone conversation with manager antonella that got me exctied about the hotel and made my decision to stay two nights insted of just one i am so glad i did thank you antonella or roma as i called youstay at the blue moon next time youre in nyc you wont be sorry,Positive
lets seethe service was so good i didnt want to leave the placei actually felt i was home other hotels i dont feel that way the front desk lady was very polite olgai think and the rest of the managementi suggest to any historic seekers to come by therethe place is an attraction in the middle of the lower east sideone more special thanks is to the owner randy settenbrino who would do anything for his guests and guide them about everything around the area,Positive
i love this hotel my husband and i stay there everytime we go to new york the staff is so friendly and the rooms are unique and comfortable perhaps the roomiest ive had in nycplus it is so nice to stay on the lower east side away from all of the tourists and traffic of midtown,Positive
had only nights in ny my friend amp i were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived stayed in the benny goodman suite only my second trip to nyc however the staff freely offered many wonderful recommendations for lunch dinner drinks and ny experiences and all the directions necessary each idea turned out to be a real treat the hotel is cosy and friendly the rooms spotless and comfortable and every aspect shows how much love has been put into its development congratulations blue moon another very satisfied and hopefully soontobe repeat customer and friend thank you,Positive
our stay at the blue moon was a highlight of new york city the small number of rooms and welcoming lobby allowed frequent interaction with the hotel staff who were the epitome of excellent service the concierge took personal interest in us and our needs answering a multitude of questions regarding directions restaurants and what to see during our short stay talking with her was like having an insiders view of the city and all her recommendations were used and thoroughly enjoyed the historic aspects of the hotel itself were charming and i was extremely appreciative of the impeccable cleanliness i fully plan on staying again at the blue moon as soon as i get another chance thank you antonella and the rest of your excellent staff,Positive
we really couldnt wait to stay with the blue moon unfortunately our parents took ill just and a half days before the date of arrival and a quick call to the manager larry he said quotno problemquot we will receive a complete refund because we called within hrs wow what a relief we cant wait to try our stay another time thanks larry the blooms,Positive
our stay was enjoyable and subject to a few reservations we would recommend it first the pluses the hotel has been painstakingly and lovingly renovated and the experience of staying there is from a historical point of view at least as interesting as the visit to the tenement museum located directly across the street which i would highly recommend staying at the hotel really feels like staying at a very pleasant museum down to the period music which was being piped into the lobbythe rooms are spacious the quality of the bed linens bathroom fixtures physical amenities etc are in line with new york hotels costing much more per night continental breakfast was rather pedestrian and quantities were limited but hey this is new york city and if youd rather pay for a bountiful breakfast in a midtown hotel be my guest ill take the complimentary breakfast any day the proprietor of the hotel is a courteous and accommodating host when we had a small issue on checkin in arranging to have two rooms our entire family of four visited the hotel on the same floor he managed to work it out for us and presented us with a complimentary bottle of wine kosher i might add for the very slight inconvenience the minuses there is not much really to say other than if you are looking for an urban experience youll find it here if not stay elsewhere yes the ambient noise from the surrounding street is in line with what you would expect from a neighborhood which is still a very authentic one think of what you would experience if you visited a small hotel on a lively street in an old building in paris and youll get the picture if youre not up for that kind of experience then stay away if youre more interested in that kind of adventure then this is more for you likewise the area itself hardly the hotels fault is quite a distance from any of the touristy parts of town you will spend a fair amount of time in taxis or on the subway and for that reason alone our next visit to new york might be spent somewhere else but all in all it was well worth the price and made for a very worthwhile and interesting visit,Positive
we normally would concur with the many reviews here and say that you wouldnt go wrong with the blue moon certainly the lobby is new the rooms are new beds firm with new showers then it is time to sleep and you wonder where is this noise coming from first it is the garbage truck then the sysco restaurant food delivery the oil delivery and by am you are wondering why you didnt get a wink of sleep then the doors start slamming the key system requires you to slam the door the problem is the hotel is right on a street that has restaurants and the deliveries come early i mean very early it is just awful on a monday am we were on the rd floor in the ella fitzgerald room facing orchard streetwhen we approach the desk clerk in the am he agreed to move us to a quieter room in the back we got back to our room at night and nope they decided not to move us the owner came out and said it was our fault making the request of a night manager vs a day manager huh he then walked away with no response quottough luckquot he mumbled quotunless you want to upgrade that is the only room we havequot so here we are with another night ready for all the noise coming right through the uninsulated front windows and the slamming doors i cant wait to check outif you dont mind sleeping a wink this place is great and bring your earplugs unless you are stone deafand by the way the pillows are cheap the shower wont drain the shower is set too high so you will bump your knees and the flat screen tvs are no bigger than a picture on my wall a joke really the breakfast is stale bagels day old pastries and tang the front door is locked after pm and all the restaurants in the neighborhood have bars on the windows lets just say this is not the safest neighborhood in ny city i felt safe but you wontbottomline you can do bettermuch better,Positive
quirky experiencemore like an inn than a hotel they try to play up the s new york feel to general success rooms are simple and nice antique furniture such as wire framed beds is a good touch bathrooms are clean and reasonably designed location gives you direct access to the lower east side and areas of chinatown that you might not experience otherwise not near the citys hotspots but near some interesting pieces reallife new york and historic new york easy access to the lower east side nightlife not too far from east villagea bit pricey for what it isi waited for it to go on sale certainly not going to spend which is rack rate,Positive
a truly unique experience beautifully refurbished historical hotela great deal considering it was only priced a few dollars more than the howard johnson down the road a fourstar hotel for just a few bucks more than a two star hotel thread count sheets huge rooms what a dealbut it is also a historical experience starting from entering the lobbyright next to the tenement museumthe owner gave us a tour and explained how the buiding was a time capsule boarded up since the thirties when they opened it up to refurbish they found many treasures which they kept and included in the decorationfascinatingon the walls were the doors to the coal ovens in each tenement apartment the tiles above the hearth line the lobby old cards invitations and newspapers from when the building was a printing shop were framed in collages on the wall medicine bottles pill boxes and other found treasures are part of the interior decorationthe owner is an artist commited to the preservation of the past how many people would take the time and effort to explore and preserve such a historic sitefinally you can tell the attention given from guests just by looking at the reviews and seeing the manegments response almost all have a responseskip times square hotels and stay on the lower east side for a unique historical comfortable experience,Positive
the blue moon may not have all the luxury extras but the hotel is gorgeous the rooms spacious and clean and the location and charm cant be beat some friends stayed further uptown in a more quotposhquot establishment and had nothing but complaints id live in the blue moon if i could afford to,Positive
we had a fantastic stay at the blue moon hotel this was our first visit to new york and we wanted to stay in a small boutique hotel the blue moon was everything we hoped it would be helpful friendly staff spotlessly clean wonderfully eccentric the lower east side may be a little ordinary during the day but at night it comes alive terrific restaurants and bars we loved new york and staying at the blue moon enhanced our adventure,Positive
this is the place to go to if you want to stay away from the conventional hugeamenity packed hotels where the service may reach excellence but the atmosphere is something you can just dream ofthe room names mine was quot tommy dorsey quot gives already an idea about the age that inspired the renovation of this nice little building in orchard street where original pieces found in the basement during the works have been reallocated all over the hotel courtesy at reception basic but nicely arranged breakfast buffet in the little entrance hall and spacious rooms made my stay really enjoyableoriginal room doors restored to perfection have original locks that you need to get used to for leaving or getting back into your room but thats part of the game,Positive
we very much enjoyed our stay at the blue moon hotel the proprietors were lovely and very proud of their property which is beautifully maintained and very clean they were extremely helpful and pleasant and full of recommendations for current attractions in the new york area the rooms are comfortable and quite large such a pleasure in new york the breakfast of fresh fruit bagels and lovely jewish pastries was tasty and very filling our only critique was that we would have loved a couple of additional bathtowels but we will certainly stay again,Positive
i decided to do some family genealogy and take a tour of the tenement museum on orchard street when i heard about the blue moon hotel and its historical interest i thought it would be a wonderful experience to stay in the neighborhood where my greatgrandparents spent many years of their life the blue moon hotel was worth every penny the service was excellent and my room was overly comfortable it is quite obvious that the owners of this unique hotel spent countless hours and capital in differentiating the blue moon hotel from its peers it reminds me of the setting of a european hotel for those who want to visit the lower east side i would highly recommend staying here,Positive
the blue moon hotel in new york city a renovated tenement building was referred to us by friends as a must it is on the lower east side of new york an old old neighborhood known for its immigrant population at the turn of the th century we had been to the quoteast sidequot quite a while back and were astonished at its revival and vibrancythe blue moon lobby is entrancing not only is it welcoming it is tastefully furnished and contains items found during the renovation of this original tenement buildingsuch as a coal oven and stove a cocacola ice box complete with bottle opener magnificent marble floors which inlcude some of the tiles found throughout the oldtenement the room we were given was the milton berle room all rooms are named after vaudeville stars including fannie bryce eddie cantor sophie tucker we were amazed at the size of the room much larger than anyroom we have ever stayed in in new york it could easily sleep four and had a table and two armchairs there was also a refrigerator stocked with dri nks next to a very convenient sink there were two dressers one of which was tall and included a desk that opened the oldtime closet was roomy it contained an ironing board and iron and a safe the windows were huge we were told they were the original windows with the original wooden frameand could actually beopened it was not noisy at all during the day as it often is midtown and at night it was so quiet it was like being in the country the showerbathtub in the bathroom actually had a door making it much more comfortable than a shower curtains it was mticulously clean as was the room and hallways having large soap bars shower gel toothbrushes and toothpaste was a nice toucha more than continental breakfast is available to all guests whichincludes bagels bialys cream cheeses rugelach pastries freshly squeezed orange juice freshly brewed coffee and tea after such a breakfast our next meal was around dinner time just being in this guest friendly historical building was a definite plus for our trip we look forward to our next trip when they will have a kosherrestaurant that they are in the process of adding on the premisesrosita finkshaulzonyahoocom,Positive
the service that we recieved from the staff there was excellent the beauty of the hotel and the rooms really made the stay wonderful being it my first time to ny the staff was very helpful in suggestions and directions around town the all over experience of the stay at the blue moon was wonderful and i know we will be back in no time to visit,Positive
stay at the blue moon if youre interested in warmth graciousness and hospitality we recently stayed one night at this charming room hotel and cant wait to have an opportunity to return the rooms were large and extremely clean and the ambience was delightful we were looking for something out of the ordinary and the blue moon didnt disappoint its truly unique in a city full of the same old run of the mill hotel chains,Positive
i have stayed in my share of new york hotel rooms and i can honestly say that the blue moon hotel on the lower east side was the best one yet it was amazing to find such a comfortable and homey ambiance in a quotcity hotelquot the staff was exceptionally polite and friendly to a fault and the frank sinatra room was not just comfortable it was beautiful a far cry from the cookiecutter rooms you see at most of the hotels in the city but dont let the quaint atmosphere fool you this hotel had all st century amenities including wireless internet access and flat screen televisions as a traveling clergyman i find location to be at least as important as quality and the blue moon delivers this hotel is perfectly suited to all the neighborhoods in the lower east side and downtown manhattan and a short walk from new yorks famous subway system in short if youre just looking for a place to lay your head at nights while in nyc the blue moon hotel is more than adequate but if youre looking for your hotel to be a part of your new york experience a memorable hotel with character beauty and charm as well as exceptional comfort the blue moon hotel is the only place you need to go,Positive
a great little european style hotel in a big city have stayed in similarly priced hotels in ny before and none compare to the hospitality the spacious spotless room i was in the one of the smallest too and the quiet i was facing the street would highly recommend for those seeking unique,Positive
the blue moon hotel on new yorks lower east side is truly charming the hotel is a meticulously renovated tenement buildingthe rooms are very large for new york nicely decorated and immaculately clean the technology is up to date with internet access and flat screen tv i have stayed there twice and both of my rooms the lowest priced overlooked orchard street the neighborhood atmosphere is unlike any i have experienced in a new york hotel it is an easy walk to the east village chinatown soho and little italy everything else is only a slightly longer walk or a short taxi or subway ride away i stayed at the blue moon the first time because it was near the theaters and other activities i had planned the second time i returned because i liked the hotel so much the old fashioned practice of leaving your key at the front desk when you step out and the fact that the front desk is staffed hours made me feel very safe the blue moon is very unique like an old time inn but with the modern conveniences it would be a pleasure to stay at such a place in any city but the fact that it is in an historic new york neighborhood makes it extra special,Positive
i stayed one night at the blue moon when i was in new york for a business trip i absolutely loved it i plan to stay there again whenever im back in the city for work or pleasurethe entire hotel is simply lovely and my room the ella fitzgerald was so much more satisfying than any other hotel ive stayed in in new york it was clean comfortable and tastefully decorated i am used to shoeboxsized rooms in nyc and this was definitely bigger than most i loved the free wireless internet in the rooms as wellmy room had a fridge coffeemaker and a flatscreen television i loved the antique desk wroughtiron bed the warm coloring on the walls and the cool light fixtures bathroom was large and wellstocked with the essentialsthe staff were so friendly and colorful i wished id have had more time to chat with everyone i encountered im no countrybumpkin but new yorkers make me nervous except for the folks at the blue moon perhaps ive stayed in too many of those painfully hip hotels and have been scarred by them i highly recommend that folks take time to check out the antiques and the paintings in the lobby beautiful i felt like i was walking back in time there was a lot of love put into the hotel and a lot of respect given to its historyi read some other reviews about noise and i will say that there was quite a bit of street noise that rose up in the early hours but um its new york city i remembered thinking of frank sinatra as i pulled the pillow over my head and appreciated the fact that it is in fact a city that never sleepsill definitely be back and have already recommended it to others,Positive
thoughtfully tastefully and authentically restored to its thcentury ambience the blue moon hotel provides a wonderful oasis conveniently located in downtown manhattan all the woodwork accessories furniture and even the decorative tin ceilings in the elevator have been restored by hand allowing even the casual visitor to quotstep back in timequot and be an aristocrat for an evening within easy walking distance of several restaurants and the subway the blue moon hotel provides great accommodations at a great priceparticularly for new york cityi was even pleasantly surprised by the continental breakfast items available gratis roundtheclock including fresh fruit assorted muffins bagels rolls croissants amp bread even in new york where almost everything is impressive youre sure to be inspired by this urban gem,Positive
well what to say on arrival we checked in with the very personable night porter we were given keys to the ella fitzgerald room which we duly made our way to on opening the door the initial reaction was wow however this was shortly followed by the realisation that somebody else already occupied this room on reporting this we were duly upgraded to the john garfield room which was slightly larger however the difference in room was a balcony not much use in new york in february the next morning we contacted check in to see if we would be moved to the original room or to stay were we were the result of this was a double upgrade to the abbot amp costello room this time there was no visible sign of an upgrade apart from the assumption that anybody in a comfort room only drinks decaf this is the first time i have been double upgraded and found the first room the most impressive other than the room issues the stay was very pleasant the rooms all three were very pleasant everything you would expect from a hotel teacoffee facilities iron safe cable etc the hotel is perfectly presented clean comfortable and very picturesque with a very laid back attitude the staff although slightly cookie were very friendly wise lunch reccommendations bar lucky strike and stay away spots times square are worth heeding definitely a good place for tourists who want to taste a bit more of the authentic new york rather than tgis and the hard rockoverall well worth a visit and would definitely stay again,Positive
when i travel i usually like to find a hotel with character not just a place to get a good nights sleep im impressed with the blue moon because it wasnt just built from a business plan designed to maximize profits from quotxquot amount of square feet this is an impressive boutique hotel and a welcome addition to manhattan my room and i got to see some of the other rooms during my twonight stay was really large it had its own bedroom area mahogany furniture a bathroom with a great shower and a view from the windows huge windows that allowed me to look over the rooftops of the lower east side buildings and see new york both during the daylight hours and at night if i was making a movie this would be on my list of locationsi spent time speaking with the owners the story of how they restored an older nyc tenement building the tenement museum in fact is right across the street with authentic detail from the building and from the period and then added original artistic treatments is a tale of love and total commitment to a project sit in the cozy lobby and youll see people on the street peek in through the windows and then walk in to ask about this special hotel on orchard street there are travelers from abroad who have discovered the blue moon and i heard one almost promise hed be back with his wife great stay and i wish them lots of luck when they open the restaurant ill be one of the first customers,Positive
we just returned from a visit to the lower east side where we stayed at this charming hotel its a very warm small friendly oldfashioned hotel located in an old tenement building next door to the tenement museum i happen to love this area and am fascinated by the history of the neighborhood so that helps but notwithstanding my predisposition to love the blue moon for its history and quaintness everything about the hotel was great we had a very comfortable room nicely decorated and an attractive bright clean new bathroom the staff were so friendly they always greeted us with smiles and remembered who we were in all our comings and goings asked about where we were from talked about the neighborhood offered us coffee and tea and kosher baked goods from local bakeries the hotel was very convenient for our needs over fri and sat you might want to ask about their plans for fri night and sat meals something coming up in the near future i cant wait till our next visit,Positive
the blue moon hotel is located in the now trendy lower east side right next door to the tenement museum and a step away from everything i went shopping on orchard street walked to chinatown and little italy this is a hotel with an incredible personality the outside is stunning and after walking into the hotel i immediately felt calm and relaxed in the beautiful lobby the owner is an artist who paid meticulous attention to the dcor with some of his own paintings adorning the walls i was thrilled with the accommodations my room was exceptionally beautiful comfy clean and new did i mention new everything was brand new bed blanket pillows dressers fixtures coffee pot fridge and flat screen tv monk would be proud the bathroom sparkled and came equipped with a deep tub which i soaked in after my day of shopping this is one of the few hotels i felt confident enough to lay down on the carpeted floor sans towel to do my yoga poses the temperature was easy to control and i kept it nice and toasty i heard that a wedding party was coming in on my second night there and was bracing myself for the festive partying but to my surprise no noise nada not a sound slept like a log and i am a very light sleeper great breakfast free ny times what else can you ask for,Positive
if you are looking for a charming hotel in the heart of the lower east side you will truly appreciate the blue moon hotelthe owners lovingly restored the building and used original materials to create a wonderfully aesthetic little gem of a hotel the display of craftsmanship used throughout the entire hotel will continually amaze and delight as you view the original tiles woodwork fixtures etc and feel the history of the building youll love itthe original artwork by the owner displayed in the lobby is stunning as well provides the quothipquot elementthere is real warmth that comes from the family style atmosphere the onsite owners convey and the staff is genuinely helpful and concerned that your stay is as pleasant as possiblethe rooms are large the bed is comfortable and cozy and theres a flat screen tv in each room cooli highly recommend this hotel,Positive
at the start of january i had to be in the lower east side for business reasons and i am highly content with choosing the blue moon hotel i found the property through expedia but i always book direct because it comes out to be cheaper the rate for my room was great and the room itself was just better than expected at first i thought because its a small hotel i would surely get a small room but i couldent have been more mistaken plenty of restaurants were close by so everything was convenient i couldent have asked for more,Positive
we spent nights over the new year at this hotel and we found it very comfortable and nicely decorated and very clean all the staff were very helpful and really nice as were other guests staying there we thoroughly enjoyed our trip and the owner was really good at pointing us in the right directions for places of interest and helped us with the new york subway system cant fault itcoffee pot on in the lobby at all times and a wonderful selection of teas to quench your thirst on arriving back after a tiring day out sightseeing would certainly recomend it bagels and coffee in the morning really set you up for the day and constant hot water in the rooms rita,Positive
the blue moon hotel is absolutely wonderful we especially enjoyed meeting the staff they are fantastic we loved them all the hotel has beautiful decor the rooms are comfortable spacious and clean though the best part were the owners and employees we will definitely come back often and soonkim and lisa,Positive
i stayed at this courtyard marriott for the nyc marathon weekend and after reading some reviews i was expecting the hotel to be very basic i was so surprised the people that work here are so nice and so helpful our room was actually really nice a good clean room with granite countertops in the bathroom and nice furniture the bed and pillows were great i am a corporate event planner by professional and can be a bit of a hotel snob trust me when i say that this hotel is much better then you expect plus you are literally facing bryant park it really doesnt get much better in terms of location,Positive
i was a bit disappointed with this marriott and kind of expected better from this chain id safely bet that this was some other chains hotel that marriott have bought over because i just felt it wasnt up to the marriott standard the rooms were smaller than usual and felt cramped hardly any daylight penetrated which didnt help as we overlooked the back of the hotel but the beds were comfortable and you dont come to new york to sit in your hotel room do youthe location is just off fifth avenue a two minute walk from the public library and maybe five minutes to times square and the empire state the immediate surroundings of the hotel is quite quiet though in terms of restaurants and bars theres a small place at the base of the hotel itself which i didnt sample and the concierge recommended a friendly diner on lexington for breakfast which was good i think it was called blooms and again was a five minute walk away there is a coffee machine in the lobby and there are a couple of delis and quotseven elevenquot style stores nearby for light snacks if necessary generally though we were out of the hotel and into the subway to somewhere else while we stayed here next time i visit manhatten i think id try a livlier area greenwhich village or the east side to stay this place although dead centre of the city is surprisingly dead itself combine this with a fairly nondescript hotel and i think youll find that although you might choose to stay here you wont be spending much time in the hotel itself and it is quite expensive for just a place to lay your head and luggage in,Positive
we stayed here and walked to so many great places times square broadway rockefellar center nbc studios titanic museum hard rock cafe and grand central station from grand central station it was a straight shot on the subway to the bowling green exit where we boarded the ferry to go to the statue of liberty we were doing the tourist thing and it was great for our purpose right next door as you are going out the door of the hotel to the left is the best delibreakfast place in town it is called charlies deli during the week they have a hot breakfast buffet where you can pick what you want and pay per the pound i ate a great breakfast for cheaper than you can eat at mcdonalds on the weekend it is order only but it was still a great breakfast but a little bit more expensive the hotel staff were excellent we had rooms and were there with family they were able to get us all on the same floor and we appreciated that greatly our rooms were on the th floor and they were typical hotel rooms full size beds typical bathroom but it was all we needed it had a closet and dresser i would definately stay here again,Positive
i stayed at this hotel after coming from another and it was a step down so i may be a bit unfair in my review which in other cases i probably wouldnt have been the location is good though i think it would be hard to find a hotel around this area that isnt fantastic the rooms were fine beds very comfortable but found a few things on the floor that hadnt been picked up from previous guests it probably could do with a bit of a revamp what truly puzzled me was the fact there is more than one quotcourtyard marriottquot and very close to eachother make sure you check your street number or you may be lugging suitcases between hotels excellent hotel for bryant park location and very convenient hour store downstairs which contains a lot of things you may need staff were generally friendly and helpful but nothing outstanding i might stay here again but probably not in a hurry dont let this put you off if the price is right as the area is fantastic the rooms clean enough and roomy enough the internet access is free and if youre in ny you wont care what your room is like at the end of the day just dont stay here for a hotel experience,Positive
the hotel is servicable and located right in the brant park area of midtown however there are many other hotels in the same area and pricepoint that are far superior if you happen to uncover a great price then it is ok the staff is pleasant and the rooms are ok although smallsimilar priced hotels in the same area that i would suggest include the residence inn on th avenue or the courtyard times square south both just a few blocks away,Positive
i booked two rooms for a family trip to new york the location was wonderful as it is only a couple of blocks from times square and within walking distance to many subway stations including grand central station what sucked was the size of the rooms and the hallways ive stayed in courtyard marriotts before as i am a rewards member and the rooms are normally smaller than than other marriott brands but not this small it was four to each room and we could barely move around the distance between the beds and the tv was approximately inches no joke also the hallway area around the elevator and the hallways in general were very narrow and the icesnack machines were only on the th th and th floors of this floor hotel i would have given cleanliness five stars but there were a few spots in the bathroom that did not appear to be mopped we covered this area with a towel so we wouldnt walk over it the bathroom was extremely small too only one person can be in the bathroom comfortably at one time unless one person was in the shower on the bright side the second room did not appear to be as small but it was smaller than normal also beware as this hotel has no pool there are three computers in the hotel with free internet access which is a life saver for having teenagers with us unless you are going alone or with your spousepartner the king bed rooms probably have a little more room i would not recommend this hotel i only booked it because it was the cheapest we could get near the times square area at per night most rooms in that area are far above that next time well prepare to pay a little more for comfort we stayed at the holiday inn on th in midtown manhattan a couple of years ago and it was very nice not only did it have a pool the rooms were large clean and very comfortable that room was per night and we would have booked it this trip but none of the other adults in the group wanted to pay over one hundred something per night they complained about the courtyard throughout the whole stay so im sure they have learned their lesson i made an unwise decision to have breakfast in the hotel one day throughout the day trip i paid including a gratuity and the buffet only included what appeared to be powdered scrambled eggs sausage bacon potatoes cereals milk and a waffle station the waffle was the best part of the breakfast there appeared to be a watery substance in the egg pan so i didnt try that i dont care for potatoes and cant really eat bacon right now so i had the sausage it looked good but it was the most disgusting sausage ive ever tasted in my life and they didnt have grapefruit juice do yourself a favor and have breakfast at the mcdonalds across the street find a restaurant in the times square area or hop on the d train to the ihop on th and adam clayton powell in harlem for those of you who are sneezing at harlem it is quite safe there there are many nice shopping places on th and not to mention the apollo is on this street as well we were actually there to witness a lot of the tributes to michael jackson that were taking place in front of the apollo and all around times square even though this courtyard marriott did not fit the bill this was and will always be a trip to remember,Positive
rooms were a bit small for a family of including teenagers but it is new york and for the price it was worth it room was very clean we were on the top th floor and it was very quiet as well the beds were a good size but too soft in my opinion excellent locationwell within walking distance of times square about or blocks and broadway and block from the subway station short cab ride to central park and other local attractions my family thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to the big apple,Positive
we got off the grand central station and pulled our small suitcases three blocks to this marriott hotel for the price the rooms may be on the smaller side but what can you expect in nyc if you are there sightseeing then youre just going to be back at the hotel to sleep and the beds are the bestclean comfy and the best it felt like a boutique hotel without the glitterthe staff at the front desk and the bartender downstairs were very friendly welcoming and made us feel right at home even the bar food was better than expected the restaurant menu looked great but we had to skip to go to a jazz italian restaurant on the lower east sidethe location of this hotel is ideal and very central cant ask for more will definitely stay again,Positive
the hotel is magnificent and i the experience was amazing it was so cold and busy there i couldnt wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel i paid per night for a room which was for sure value for moneyoverall i would say the experience was good,Positive
this is a really nice hotel in a great location traditional marriott hotel very clean comfortable not too fancy the rooms are small which is typical for new york we stayed on the th floor there are floors with only rooms per floor could occasionally hear people closing doors or talking in hall but did not hear any noise between rooms staff is very friendly especially the bellmen small business center has three computers two with printers and third with no printer small exercise room with two treadmills a eliptical machine and stationary bike free coffee and tea on mezzanine level elevators were very fast never had to wait for very long no onsite parking but there is a lot two blocks away on th street hotel offers a valet service possibly for a fee a block from fifth avenue and the beautiful new york public library blocks from the empire state bldg blocks from the st bryant park subway station or blocks from the st station for the local train which goes to time square or grand central station depending on direction within walking distance to all landmarks on fifth avenue rockafeller center st patricks cathedral trump tower and other high end fifth avenue shops short blocks to central park great deli next store quotcharlies deliquot which serves as hotel room service open hrs and very reasonable prices the restaurant next store salmon river serves a buffet breakfast as a guest at the hotel you can buy a voucher for per person which includes tax and gratuity if not its not including tax or gratuity breakfast is until am on weekdays and am on sat and sun most places in the city stop serving breakfast at although we paid with points spoke with other people who said room rates were reasonable when compared to other midtown manhattan hotels great location if visiting the city for the first time andor with kids,Positive
unlike other marriott chain hotels i stayed thus far this hotel does not live up to the name marriott although the location was perfect for us depending on what youre planning to do in nyc the hotel was narrow in width off fifth avenue we had room with beds no extra space besides the end of beds i was reminded of a small apartment room i used to rent when i lived here in manhattan years ago our room was very cold because the heater fan was malfunctioned i found out about it from a technician on the last day our staywe stayed nights although a checkin clerk promised me that he would talk to the manager to lower my rate they still charged me for the third night and airline industry rate for the fourth night i used points for the first two nights after checking out i noticed that they had lowered the rate but a checkout clerk didnt even double check to see if i got my request granted i guess that he had a quottypicalquot male attitude towards a minority woman like me only good experience was a bell man who had a pleasant smile and serving attitude and a female clerk who was willing to exchange my bills to quarters for bus ride she was cuteone scoop for this location is that youll find a japanese market on st street right around the corner and a japanese bakery store next to it they were awesomefor this price i could have stayed at ramada new yorker hotel for a bigger room and bigger lobby with sitting area at least new yorker hotel is more lively,Positive
we just returned from a weekend stay at this hotel we stayed saturday april sunday april th the hotel is in a good location and the staff is great but watch out what you read on other sites the manager told me this happens often so make sure you know what you are getting before you bookwhen i booked with orbitz i was under the impression that we were getting free breakfast in the morning that is not true the restaurant at the hotel isnt owned by marriott so you have to pay i was told by the manager this is one of the only marriotts in the city that doesnt provide breakfast on the internet on numerous sites i was free breakfast our next surprise was that our room only had two double beds and no pull out sofa bed we were under the impression that we would have this because of information on the internet about the hotelmy advice is be careful what you read about this hotel if you have questions call dont let it be a surprise it is in a good location but you can stay closer to the action in times square for almost the same price the reason we stayed here was because of the free breakfast and pull out bed,Positive
stayed one night price was good for a clean safe hotel conveniently locatedstaff was very helpful even lent us an umbrella toothpaste we forgot was brought up to room surprised look when i offered a tiparranged for a car to pick us up at am driver was incredible cant say enough about his kindnesshe changed my thinking about nyc i only wish i had his name i know he lives in queensthank you to him,Positive
location is ideal about a five min walk from times square room was big for new york with double beds free business centre with printer available to all guests along with complimentary tea and coffee staff were friendly and helpful,Positive
this hotel was great for location literally minute from th avenue and all the attractions i would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting new york for this alonethe rooms were smallish but fine for a long weekend break it was clean and modern nothing wow but depending on why you are in new york will depend on what sort of standard of hotel you are looking forthere was free access to the internetprinters handy for when reserving your flight seats on the way home a restaurantbar below the hotel tooi would recommend brooklyn diner in time square but dont bother with planet hollywood if you like those sort of places,Positive
good sized king room for nyc rooms on each floor that end in are end rooms and much larger no views in these rooms great night visit couldnt be happier,Positive
hotel location was ideal for exploring new yorkroom was clean with complimentary coffee which was replenished everydaycomplimentary coffee and tea available in the foyer for guestscomplimentary internet access with printer availablestaff were helpful and friendlydeli next door with good range of food at reasonable price,Positive
youll notice some pretty okayaverage ratings on some of the key points but that my overall rating was poor lets get through those and then ill get into why cleanliness housekeeping did their job but left used glasses with liquid still in them in the room without replacing or cleaning them and seemed to quotrinse downquot the tub without actually doing a light scrub basically i left conditioner streaked on the shower wall and didnt realize it was still there when i came back after housekeeping everything else was fine location th avenue as central you can get for a price below night without giving up too many amenities rooms i was lucky and randomly got given a handicap room this gave me a good amount of space closet was tiny by the way also i do not know if this is true for all rooms but my room was facing the street this meant i got a wicked cold room with a heater that was blowing degree air when it was literally below freezing outside this made it so cold i couldnt sleep and it was unbearable the heater simply could not keep up i had to ask for extra blankets an engineer to look at it and finally got a space heaterit is freezing in nyc and i know thats not usual but the insulation between the wall and the machines is very poor the machines are built into the wall which means they are exposed to the cold winds and below freezing temperatures outside these machines need to be checked to be sure they are up to snuff properly insulated and if only some rooms suffer from the extreme cold they should make more of an effort to be proactive with guests rather than leaving it up to guests to figure outtelevision comes with a limited number of channels the usual extras like the interactive tv is not available keyboard games i dont use these so it didnt matter you get free wifi which was key it was a poor connection but you can also use a hard ethernet line if you want value overall technically this is a star hotel but due to the issues i had above and more below i dropped it to a service this will cover why its a star hotel at least until they make some changes in staff attitude and figure out that being kind to customers up front will get them to come back you saw the above input on the heating situation the night i checked in i came back down to ask for change the desk guy was actually very nice but he was ending a call where a guest was complaining about their heater and thinking it was broken the guy seemed irritated with the guest as if they were being unreasonable and rolled his eyes then finished the call and helped me he didnt seem to care and i had the feeling the problem wouldnt get fixed this exchange made me scared to ask for help with my heater later when in my room i was freezing that night i called down a few hours later for a blanket it was barely tolerable and i slept huddled under that with my winter jacket over methe next night i asked for another blanket it was still too cold so i finally braved calling down and they sent an engineer up he was nice but really couldnt do anything he futzed around with the settings and the machine and got it go blow more air but not hot air so all he could do was shrug then luckily he offered a space heater which it did not occur to me theyd have so i used that to survive that little thing kept me more warm than the regular heaternext day i asked for a credit of some sort for the situation i got a condescending agreement to give me a bunch of points since id paid in points not cash main reason for the low rating am on saturday night the fire alarm goes off it sounds once then keeps blinking no one gets on the intercom to warn us or explain i get into full freezing weather gear and im on the th floor super close so i walk down the stairs since youre not supposed to use the elevators i get down closer to the st floor and the lower level is flooded the stair system here is a dual system behind the elevators so i exit one side go around the elevator and down the second stairwell i get down to the employeestaff area i look around and call for help no answer i return to the stairwell and attempt to go further down encounter more flooding i go back to the mezzanine and out i see smoke and darkness and sprinklers and hear water i walk out to the railing down below darkness and a bunch of firemen standing around a fire truck out on the street a family comes out of the stairwell were the first to make it down they came down fro the th floor on foot i call down to the firemen and ask if its safe they say yes but explain nothing no staff anywhere they basically abandoned the guests with a fire alarm going offeventually at least min later the fire men seem to have found the engineer who came to my room and he lets them into the office above the reception area and then they come back out and go do whatever else we wait some more eventually braver people navigate the slick marble stairs of the renovation half of the lobby and get down to the main level to ask the fire fighters whats up eventually the direction trickles back that a pipe burst were safe we can go back to our rooms no firefighter makes an official announcement theres no fire were not in danger its not his job its a staff members job but where are theyeventually we go back to our rooms its now am or so a firefighter gets on the intercom finally states the situation and says we should stay in our rooms they should have done that first thing or a staff member should havenext morning i come down the elevator and the staff there in the morning act like everythings fine like nothing ever happened but the carpet guard in the hallway is still soaking wet all the flooded water and destroyed everything are mysteriously back in order except earlier when i called down to check whether i could use the elevator the front desk phone line was heavily staticky and i could barely hear the person on the other endwhen i check out and mention the issues ive encountered with heat and the fire alarm and ask for some kind of credit the woman has an attitude and is acting like im the one making up stories or trying to game the system or make a big deal out of nothingum where were you at am in the morning when i was deep asleep and a fire alarm went off and i didnt know if i was safe or not nowhere so you should be more than happy to make sure every guest in the hotel that night got something for their trouble she agreed to give me points but not a significant amountclear staff issues i had a pleasant preexperience with elsa via email who helped me work out combining a reservation of points and cash and followed up with her to make sure the manager actually credited me the points of course the front desk who gave me attitude during my stay didnt credit me a thing so i followed up with elsa who forwarded my email to the manager and voila they gave me the points i was promised plus a little morewhich is great but the underlying questions remain what does your staff do when your guests are extremely inconvenienced and paying for a room that should be keeping them warm and safe what do you do when your guests are afraid for their lives and turn to you the hotel staff to reassure them of their safety and explain where they should go and whennote the main issues i had were not with staff who make the hotel run housekeeping bellmen valet engineer but with staff who run the program day or night not only are they the face of the hotel they are responsible for ensuring guests are cared for comfortable safe and respected and they definitely didnt hold up on their end of the bargain other notes on the general experience you can order in from the deli next door id recommend you do this or order from anyone else other than room service too expensive also note they dont put the phone number for these restaurants in the book the deli has a direct dial key on the phone but the other restaurants dont youll have to ask the front desk for their numbers or look them up onlinei only experienced long waits for the elevator in the early evening when other people were coming in from being out an aboutthe lobby is indeed extremely small and is split in half undergoing renovation this means if there are guests in line at the desk and people waiting for the elevator or trying to get through the lobby it can become a messthe gym is tiny with old equipment it works but its not great has a good sound system and tv though business center looked pretty tiny but appeared to function finefree coffeetea on the mezzanine level which came in handyin room digital safegood hot water flow and water pressure from the bathroom,Positive
great hotel for family and friends in the heart of nyc though the rooms are considered average size for nyc seemed small but very clean and fresh smelling all of the hotel staff was very helpful with parking luggage area restaurants and directions for nearby sights also the staff was very friendly and considerate to the children we were traveling with they are remodeling the lobby area so the front desk is a small space check in and out was rather loud but quick and efficient,Positive
we visited nyc december so we had a long stay with adults and child in one room we had a great experience with all the servicethe rooms were clean and edna did a great job in our room willie and frank were also very helpful and kind this was our first time to nyc and the hotel was close to everything we needed to get to what a great way to spend christmas vacation and we would come back to this hotel for our next visit,Positive
we were looking for an affordable price plus a decent locationthis courtyard offered both but i was worried about booking due to a few negative reviews listed on ta since our stay was during the nd week of dec when nyc hotels price gouge i decided to take a chance because of the rateunder per night upon arrival at pm we were warmly greeted and made to feel welcome by sophia at the front deskshe had accommodated my request for room location and the checkin was quite efficient the room was large clean well appointed and the beds very comfortable bathroom was good size with plenty of towels soft a great shower and again very clean the only draw back was space around bathroom sinkthis is not a complainti just seem to have alot of quotstuffquot and always appreciate plenty of space to place things lighting in hotel bathrooms can always be improved upon especially for makeup application and this bathroom could use better lighting in that respect the only other item that would have been nice to have in the room was a refrig noise coming through the walls from other guests which was mentioned in some other reviews was nonexistence hallways were brightly lit and we had no problems with elevators running slow nor did we encounter any surly bellmen when we were having our luggage checked and then retrieved later in the dayone minor pointnot a complaintlobby is small so there is not many places to sit if someone needed to do some waiting etchappily we found this courtyard to be quite pleasant and would stay again location was finewe did not feel uncomfortable walking in the area very late at nightalmost forgot to mentiona huge deli with friendly service and an enormous selection of food items for breakfastlunchdinner and snacks is right next door and around the corner on th ave between thst a more upscale deli with a few tables,Positive
we stayed here for nights in december the location of the hotel is very convenient it is between th amp madison aves a couple of blocks from grand central and withing reasonable walking distance of times square the hotel is on a small footprint the lobby is very small and each floor only has about rooms although we booked a king room we ended up in a double the room was small just enough space for the bed a desk and a dresser the bathroom was decent sized given the room size all the usual amenities were present and the room was clean overall this is a good option for the area with the only real issue being the room downgrade,Positive
went for a weekend girls trip and had a blast hotel was conveniently located and made it very easy to navigate the streets of ny the morning crew is excellent anything you need they went above and beyond we arrived three hours before checkin and were promptly escorted to our room night staff were not that great you could tell the difference between morning management and night management rooms were small but thats typical ny real estate would defintiely stay there again,Positive
we stayed at the courtyard th ave for nights rooms were on the small side but were modern and clean our room was on the th floor toward the back of the building it was very quiet the staff was fine the doormen were very helpful the location is great close to grand central bryant park and the fifth ave shops also there is a great little food store just to the right of the hotels entrance that was so good and convenient i would pick this hotel again just for it i cant comment on the room prices versus other hotels since i stayed on points overall recommended,Positive
great location for sightseeing and walking around new york we stayed here for nights and staff were v nice and helpful rooms not v large but clean and comfortable,Positive
we stayed here for nights during a leisure trip to new york city our room wasnt available when we arrived but they took our cell phone number and called when it was ready front desk and bell staff were very friendly and helpful taking care of everything we needed such as a check cashed and transportation to the airportthe room we were in had a queen bed and was on the th floor it was not huge but it was a very good size for a new york city hotel room we adults had plenty of space to spread out our stuff the room was very quiet at night with the exception of the occasional emergency vehicle rumbling past we did not hear noise from our neighbors at all it was clean and well stocked with everything we needed for our stay there was no view but we did not expect onethe location was very convenient to the empire state building times square rockefeller center the public library and fifth avenue it was an easy walk back to the room after seeing a broadway showgrand central station was also close by and we took the subway everywhere else we wanted to go we didnt eat at the hotel but there are plenty of good places to eat close by we had a great stay and i would definitely return,Positive
my wife and i stayed here for a night while visiting new york in september of we arrived around pm before the scheduled checkin time our room was not available so the front desk clerk took our credit card information and told us to see the bellman to store our bags she certainly wasnt friendly and didnt provide any indication of when our room would be available we went and saw a show had dinner did some shopping and returned to the hotel around pm there was only one girl working the front desk chatting with a friend on the phone we told her we needed our room keys and she typed a bit on the computer while still talking to her friend and presented us with the keys we then had to see the bellman for our bags he offered to deliver them to our room which we indicated wasnt necessary because they were only two small rollerboards apparently their luggage storage isnt on the main level whereas he took the elevator up and came back down with the bags minutes later no thank you here you go or anything again quite disappointing the room itself was small the walls were paper thin and the bathroom left a lot to be desired the one thing we were happy with was the elevator a wait is generally expected at tall ny hotels but this never seemed to be a problem at this hoteloverall we were not pleased with this hotel and will not return in the future id be willing to shell out the extra bucks for the renaissance or marriott for a better hotel in a better location,Positive
the prospect of arriving in manhattan after pm on a sunday night did not make me happy especially since i had to do back to back trade shows what a pleasant relief to arrive at the courtyard be greeted like a friend instead of just another late checkin and this is the best part finding a hr deli next door that actually delivers at pm and the food is pretty darn goodof course manhattan is the only place that has these great places that have hot and cold salad bars and just about everything else you can think of some of which are open the next day i made a terrible mistake which could have turned into a disaster i forgot to include the slip with my dry cleaning when i realized it that night i called the front desk in a panic they told me not to worry that i wasnt the first person this had happened to and sure enough minutes later they delivered my favorite pants to the roomthe room is just fine bed is ok bathroom is small like most nyc hotels but updated and clean the view there was none but i had already been warned about that the location is great close to east side and west side appointmentsill be back,Positive
this was our first trip to nyc this hotel was very convenient to rockefeller center times square and the empire state bldg the staff was very friendly and very helpful the room was very comfortable and very nicely sized and overall the hotel was very clean we would stay again,Positive
this is a great hotel we stayed from within walking distance of times square rockefeller center grand central empire state building and lots of great shopping there is a little store next door that serves a buffet at breakfast lunch and dinner plus has snacks drinks fruit etc our room was very clean and although a little small we didnt feel cramped i originally wanted to stay in times square but was very glad we stayed here because it was virtually noisefree at night the front desk was very helpful and ready to accommodate our requests one suggestion request a room on a high floor so you can have a view will definitely stay here again when we return to nyc,Positive
we stayed at the courtyard marriott for nights in may it was our first visit to new york city and we were looking for a centrally located hotel it was a fantastic location two minutes to bryant park and the new york public library we could also walk to broadway theatre district time square the shops of fifth avenue rockefeller plaza and grand central station the hotel has an arrangement with a parking garage blocks away where we parked our car for the weekendthe hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with restaurant suggestions etcthe rooms are clean and modern and just as they appear on the website not large but we expected that in new york city the beds and linens were very comfortable we actually had a room on the top floor th and even had a bit of view the bathroom has been completely renovated and was actually quite large and very clean the elevators were fast and no long waits there is hour coffee in the lobby and internet access and printers there is also an exercise roomthere is a great hour deli right next door where we could get bagels and fresh orange juice in the morning and anything else we needed they had a huge assortment of salads sandwiches muffins desserts fresh fruit everythingwe would defintely recommend the courtyard marriott especially for the location and friendly and helpful staff there is so much to see and do in new york citythat we were only in the hotel to sleep shower and change walking shoes at noonwe will probably stay here again on our next trip to new york city,Positive
stayed here for weeks if you have never stayed in a room in nyc do not expect a spacious room square footage costs are high so soace is expensivethe room was well thought out though i wish i had a small fridge bathroom was big enough for me quot room was always clean elevators was very fastyou are south of midtown but can easilt get most anywhere with madison ave going all north on one end of the street and fifth the other end going all south,Positive
our first time in new york and we felt really at home in the hotel the staff were friendly and helpful the rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable we were amazed at how quiet it was inside the room made great use of the free internet the location was brilliant easy walking distances to so many places grand central empire state times square and the subway was minutes away for further excursions had breakfast once at the hotel but found charlies next door more versatile and much much cheaper ate at salmon river hotel restaurant times and enjoyed the food and the service we will certainly stay there again next time we come to new york,Positive
we have stayed here twice now while in new york on business the first time was a complete fluke as it was merely one of the hotels with which our convention organizers had negotiated a favorable rate and we picked it pretty much on price it was one of the more reasonable optionswe were surprised and charmed by the helpful staff who were consistently delightful and very patient with a couple of nervous canadians when i telephoned the front desk a couple of days prior to our arrival to confirm our room i asked whether it would be better to take a cab from the airport or to grab one of the airport shuttles the desk clerk put me through to the doorman on duty who very kindly outlined the best route told me what i should expect to pay and generally how not to appear like a rube quottell the cabbie to take the tunnel its cheaperquot he saidthe rooms were small but comfortable in each case the bathrooms were obviously recently renovated the restaurant in the hotel is convenient if a tad expensive there were two computers available for guests use with free internet access allowing you to check flight status and emailthe hotel is located beside a twentyfourhour convenience store deli that sells hot and cold food great for a snack there are tons of little restaurants within walking distance especially a few streets to the east lexington avenue i think where we discovered a nice japanese place and a moroccan place both reasonably priced there were more attractive restaurants than we had time to try in each casea great little hotel,Positive
although the hotel is in an excellent location of manhattan the hotel appears to be quotsqueezedquot in between to other buildings i was surprised of how tiny the lobby was if you want any type of room view request a room in the front of the building your view will be overlooking the ny public library i must remind you you are located on a busy street so you will hear traffic and plenty of sirens from police and ambulances bring earplugs plenty of fast food places and shopping close by broadway just a few blocks away only one person can get into the bathroom at one time the water temp was not very hot for a showerthe hallway is so small two people cannot possibly so side by side at the same time if you get a room on the nonstreet side you will be looking at brick walls from the neighboring hotelsno view at all it looked depressingthe staff was soso appeared not to like their jobs when we called to have the conceirge to call for restaurant reservations for two separate nights he was rude and said he was too busy and to call back in about an hour i couldnt believe it and actually went immediately downstairs and found no manager on the premises so will contact marriott to complain when i return home no help available at night to help with luggagealthough im trying to remain positive in regards to positive things of the hotel the last good thing about it was a great deli next door this is also your room servicewhich does time a long time to receiveall in all for a frequent traveller i was highly disappointed in this hotel and never will return,Positive
the marriott courtyard on fifth is a great value centrally located in midtown with excellent shopping and cultural experiences located nearby the subway is several blocks away which is a little inconvenient but certainly walkable distance the staff was very nice helpful and attentive the doormen were especially helpful holding bags for us after we checked out and arranging for a car to the airport the breakfast buffet is served at the adjoining restaurant and is pretty standard for a courtyard breakfast the service was exceptional though the rooms are not huge but i have been in smaller the bathrooms are similar i found my stay to be quite quiet despite other users reviews it is nice to have the deli next door for cheap snacks and meals i think the courtyard is an excellent value for such a prime location,Positive
stayed at this hotel with my husband and daughter for nights in december january very pleased with everything about this hotel location great for shopping and sightseeing room clean and cosy and great housekeepingthe only down side was that our room had no view whatsoever we looked out on to walls and officeswe were on the nd floor so we did expect to be able to see something but as we didnt spend that much time in our room it was not a major issuewe went to pax wholefoods for breakfast each day as it is great fresh food at vey good prices,Positive
we stayed here for nights we found the hotel to be clean nice bathroom and had very comfortable beds the room was not overly big but was fine as you do not spend a lot of time in the hotel we found the location was perfect a few blocks from time square empire state building the rockefeller centre and grand central station,Positive
my girlfriend and i stayed here three nights on points my expectations are generally low for hotels in nyc as they can often be cramped and noisy i must stay this hotel exceeded my expectationsthe room was well appointed and had one of the most comfortable beds i have had at any hotel nice lcd tv and the room was actually nice sized for nyc the bathroom was somewhat small but very adequatethe hotel is very well located on the corner of th and th right by the ny public library you just cant beat the location and can walk to times square and access the subway easilythe front desk staff was courteous and helpful we had the breakfast buffett on one day and thought it was adequatethe one downer was the elevators they took forever this is a story room hotel with two elevatorsso be prepared to waitoverall i would not hesitate staying at this hotel again,Positive
we used our marriott rewards to stay for five days excellent location we had a king bed room more than adequate as we arent the type to spend a lot of time in the room have had smaller in nyc very no frills lobby had breakfast for two in the adjacent restaurant a small but nice buffet what more do you need to get up and get going if breakfast is not included head two doors down to the left and eat at the charlies it is a combo deli grocery and buffet during the week there is a full compliment of salad bar and hot foods that you buy by the pound lots of choices weekends are slim pickings as they dont put much out since the business crowd is gone we walked everywhere but you can get a cab right outside the door if you want remember that the traffic may take longer to get where you want to go than just walking nothing fancy but clean and safe would recommend it to anyone,Positive
i stayed in this hotel for six days when i travel with the family to my first visit in the us and all i have nothing bad to say about itit has a excellent location a couple of steps and you are in the heart of manhattan times squarebroadway besides you are near of the major avenuesthe service has very friendly they leave you the usa today every day next to your door plus you have free internet access by cable in your room with a good speed actually and free wireless access in the lobby if you dont have a laptop you have there computers and a faxprinter so you dont have to worryi tried also the restaurant below the hotel and i love it the service to the customers has excellent and the food has great if you like salmon you have to try itgetting to the hotel is easy and you have there a excellent service with the valets that book you any showtour you want and call you a cablimousinerent a car if you need iti have nothing to complain since i love going to new york and i wish to return there more often there are plenty of people in the street you dont need any transportation since you can walk to anywhere and you have anything you want near youawesome experience i recommend it to anyonethe only thing that i need to warn you is not to use the super shuttle service besides i have to wait min in the airport they didnt show in the day to pick us up to the airport in our way back thankfully i was able to get my refund do this terrible servicesorry about my poor english and good travels to everyone d,Positive
we stayed in courtyard fifth avenue east th street for two weeks and feel at home there the hotel is nothing special in facility and the rooms are small but the location is superb near to almost everywhere we are really impressed with the staffs from the friendly front desk staffs to the very helpfull and knows everything guest service man he helps us almost with everything from restaurant recomendation to car and limousine booking and he recomends really good limousine driver and answered all our question promptly he rreally made us feel at home in our very first visit to new york will definitely recomend this hotel and will definitely looking forward to come back to this hotel again,Positive
we were here for two nights earlier this week great staff with helpful recommendations for restaurants and very nice bar staff too the hotel is in a great location just by the new york library and within easy walking distance of the empire state building its a minute walk to times square our rooms were nice and a good size by manhattan standards but do not have a view bathroom nice good amenities and lovely soft beds and pillows there is a coffee maker in the room elevators are speedy the bar is very nice and roberto was a wonderful server and really made us laugh go to blooms for breakfast right down the street eddie on reception deserves special mention for all the help he gave us and the staff helping us with our bags were very friendly courteous etc cant say enough good things about this hotel and would definitely stay here again,Positive
we meant to book the other courtyard hotel just two blocks down on the same street but made a mistake so we were a little disappointed on principlebellhop doorman very helpful both on arrival and departure different people reception efficient but nothing special i certainly didnt feel welcome as an elite marriott rewards customerthere is very little to the hotel it has a tiny lobby tiny little exercise room and a coffee area that was not in use when we were there but there is restaurant to one side of the hotel and a deli to the other side the deli will do room deliverythe room was mostly clean small but then all nyc rooms are small the beds were very comfortable the ac worked well but was very noisy the free internet was not speedy and not wireless so had to compete with my teenage son all in all the room was fineso whats the gripe simply not worth a for one night before tax there is far better to be had in nyc i guess location may be one reason or the other will simply be people misbooking the th most popular hotel in new york for this one because i certainly will not go back at that price,Positive
the courtyard by marriott new york manhattanfifth avenue is centrally located at fifth avenue and th street and is a tall narrow building with a tiny lobby and reception area so thats your first clue that the rooms will also be small and they are but they have been recently renovated and are functional clean freshsmelling spaces the bathroom was surprisingly large relative to the size of the roomhowever the renovation budget obviously did not include any allocation for soundproofing and because the hotel is so centrallylocated it is on a very busy street with loud trucks and honking taxis at all hous of the day and night and because the rooms are so tiny the neighbors are in close proximity and you can hear each door open and close every sneeze every toilet flush etc do not accept a room on or as those floors have noisy ice machines in the hallways yes in the hallway not in a closet with a door as you would find in most other hotelsbeware too of any rooms on the nonstreet side of lower floors as they are claustrophobic the windows offer views of brick walls of the tall neighboring structures we changed from floor to and were much happierthe staff is quite pleasant and accomodating but do not expect any offer of help with baggage or hailing taxis those services are nonexistentthe deli next door is open so thats your room serviceall in all its a fairly good value but i have stayed at much nicer quieter nyc hotel options in this price range i wont be returning to this courtyard,Positive
consdering the peack period we got a double room small but clean despite the dust on the side table the staff r more than polite and helpful may be the facade of the hotel needs do be more chique close to bus stop and subway i recommend it if you didnt find roomsavaialable at the marriott marquis try to check the marriott websitein advance to find a good deal,Positive
this is a perfect location to stay in nycwalking distance to times square grand central station central park amp empire state buildinglocated at th ave amp bryant park so you can turn the corner and shop until your hearts contentthe rooms were very clean and we stayed in and this is a king room with a desk and sofa and a very large bathroomvery large room for nyc standardsthe view wasnt great at all and this courtyard doesnt serve breakfast but all in all i would highly recommend and would stay there againmaybe their are some small rooms there but not oursare rate was great too worth every pennyit is not the frills and thrills of staying at times square but not the price either,Positive
midtown manhattan great location friendly and helpful staff rooms somewhat small but clean and well appointed,Positive
we booked this hotel on the same day and we were pleasantly surprised the staff was polite and helpful the rooms were small but that was to be expected you are right near bryant park and the library you are close to shopping and walking distance to the theatre district and there is an inroom fridge i would recommend this hotel for a weekend stay only because any longer might feel claustrophobic in that tiny space,Positive
i have stayed in many wonderful nyc hotels so all of the glowing reviews for this hotel puzzle me yes the hotel staff are friendly and accomodating and the location is central to all midtown hotspots but otherwise this facility is simply adequate and no more there is no lobby to speak of and the rooms are small without refrigerators and are in need of some maintenance my safe did not work either i probably had the same room as the earlier reviewer the mezzanine coffee bar was not replenished regularly and the adjacent bar and restaurant closed extremely early this courtyard is reasonably priced comfortableclean and definitely acceptable in a pinch but do look elsewhere first,Positive
good central location and everuthing works as it should breakfast out of house in local vicinity but limited choice free internet access on two computers on mezzanine level,Positive
just last month june my party of went to new york and stayed at the courtyard new york manhattanfifth avenue at east th street we booked the rooms by using marriott reward points but the rate that we would have paid was the location was the best that we could ask for we booked two double rooms one for my mother and myself one for my uncle aunt and two cousins the rooms were smaller than they generally are throughout the country but for nyc they were of a good size my mother and i had plenty of room including room to store our luggage my other family members were a bit cramped but there are four of them and they tend to be a bit chaotic anyway the beds were very comfortable especially after a long day of walking there was also highspeed internet in the rooms in addition to two computers and printers in the mezzanine which was great so that you can print off your boarding passes the bathroom was of a good size pretty standard for anywhere and the soap shampoo etc provided was of good quality housekeeping was great as wellwe did eat at the attached restaurant for breakfast one day and although it was good the offerings were limited and when they run out it took a little while for them to replenish there were eggs bacon sausage fresh fruit it was good waffles croissants bagels cereal a selection of juices milk and other beverages i may be missing something but cant put my finger on itthe better place to eat was cafe charlies which was on the other side it was twentyfour hours and is a cross between a convenience store a grocery store and a restaurant there was food that you could take of a shelf and purchase a salad bar setup with many different options including fresh fruit delicious and perfect and a grill area where things were madetoorder including bagels french toast pancakes etc the only meal we ate there was breakfast and it was great we did stop in one night after we had gotten back late and got some cake which was very good strawberry shortcake cheesecake and black forest were what we had this is another good part of the location of the hotel so i thought it was appropriate to include itback to the hotel the staff was wonderful always offering help when we went to phantom of the opera on friday night and were running late the concierge ran down to th avenue hopped in a taxi and brought it to us they were all very helpful with anything we neededthe hotel was very quiet as there were only seven rooms if i remember correctly on each floor we never had to wait for an elevator for more than thirty seconds there was a gym with a couple of treadmills stationary bikes and a few more machines there were two computers and printers that were available for guests to use which was great as we could checkin for our flight back home and print off our boarding passes the hotel itself was gorgeous and looks just like the pictures on the websitethe marriott company has still not disappointed usplease let me know if you have any questions,Positive
we stayed here for nights over the th of july weekend using marriott reward pointsthis hotel is in a fabulous location in midtown on th st at th ave just blk from the ny public library blk from bryant park and a few blocks from the chaos of times squarewe agree with the other reviews about the small rooms but of course this is nyc and small hotel rooms are commonplace i have stayed at other nyc hotels in the past sheraton nyc paramount etc where the rooms were actually smaller than at this hotel our room had a queen bed which was comfortable the closet was small but we didnt need to use it the bathroom was pretty small as well with minimal counter space but a decent showertub the ac unit was loud but that was ok with us as the walls were very thin and we could hear doors closing people in their rooms and when people got onoff the elevator the plasma tv was a very nice touchwe had absolutely no problems with the timliness of the elevators the most we had to wait for an elevator was maybe minutestaff was great checking to see how our stay was and if we needed anything they arranged for the car service to the airportwe did not eat at the hotel but the quotsalmon grillequot restaurant is supposed to be quite good and it has a nice patio which was always crowded in the eveningswe were out and about in nyc so we really did not spend much time in the room at all except to sleep but if we did spend more time in the room i think we would have become a bit claustrophobic this hotel was just fine for us and we loved the location,Positive
great location average staff at checkinout very good concierge free internet available at the business center and in the room the room was ok but i really had trouble sleeping since the elevators are really noisy and run all the time i usually do not mind noisy neighbors but the wall was so thin that the head of my bed was shaking i wouldnt have complained too much if i wasnt alone,Positive
of us stayed here couples in february for nights it really is in a perfect location off fifth avenue the double room is small but you dont go to new york to stay in your room its spotlessly clean and has everything you need location wise it was great the polish doorman is so helpful and will advise on where to go and how to get discountsthere is a hour deli next door if you get peckish and there are vending machines in the hallways of some floors on the hotel if you want a mineral during the night would definately return to new york and stay here again as it really was great they also arranged a town car to bring us back to the airport new ark and that worked out the same price as the cab to the hotel next time ill just arrange for them to collect us from the airport,Positive
my wife and i had our first visit to nyc room was not big but nice my son said it was bigger than the milford plaza which he stayed at in january staff was very courteous restaurant was nice stay off the th th and th floors that is where the ice machines are very noisy as soon as you get off the elevators and the halls were much warmer,Positive
stayed here during december for some holiday shopping and sightseeing perfect location adjacent to bryant park which is now a picturesque ice skating rink and artists fair with yummy hot chocolate and treats one block off fifth avenue which is ideal for window shopping but beware of the holiday crowds of course also adjacent to ny public library and a nice leisurely walk to broadway this was helpful because we could not get a cab after the show so we just walked back to the marriott breakfast buffet is plentiful fresh and nice selection not sure of the cost because we had free vouchers our room faced th street and the noise was not that bad all staff is very accommodating their recommendation of pizza joint down the street was exactly what we wanted rooms are newly renovated and clean nice bath and body works toiletries this is not your hip see and be seen hotel but rather a decent choice for shopping sightseeing and dining in the heart of manhattan,Positive
i read previous reviews of this hotel which were quite positive and i decided to stay here for one night for business on the positive side it was quite clean renovated and the lobby was basically a place to check in with an elevatorthe restaurant was off the lobby its in a great location off fifth avenue and th street i was shocked at how small this hotel is in comparison to other courtyardshotels i have stayed at in manhattan and other large cities i am actually a new yorker so i am very familiar with manhattan and this hotel was located very close to where i had an early business meeting so i thought i would spend the night rather than having to take a very early train in from the suburbs i checked in about pm and the room had a queen size bed a credenza with a flat screen tv two night tables and a small bathroom usually considered the size of a quothalf bathquot this was the entire room for per nite including all taxesit was a good thing i only needed to sleep here and check out since there was no chair other than the desk chair to even sit on and you bumped into the bed each time you tried to move around the room soi still say this location is great but be prepared to be claustrophobic in the quotqueen sizequot room or book a king or double bed room for a bit more money to have more space,Positive
the good location just off th ave and bryant park front desk service was excellent room size was above average for nyc bed was comfortable best iron i ever used bar made a great martinithe bad shower head was broken and i cut my hand trying to fix it inroom safe was broken worst of allthis is a nonsmoking hotel and i awoke to the smellof smoke coming through the vent in the bathroom every morning disgusting i hope the inconsiderate person or people who smoked in their room were charged the appropriate fee to quotsmokefreequot their room again,Positive
my husband has to travel to ny for business a few times a year me and the kids go with him each time his job usually books at a quotposhquot hotel but we have opted to have them book us at this hotel every time we go we absoloutely love it the staff is amazing frank oriandosp willy and so many more the recognize us each time we pull up and take very good care of us i usually have my boys in a double stroller and they are excellent with helping me they walk down to th to flag me a taxi anytime i need onewhen it is raining and they always have the info i need on anything the rooms are clean and spacious and great bath and body works toiletries i find salmon rivertheir restaurant to be a little pricey and not much selection i have kids but cafe charlie next door is awesome they have a great breakfast and anything you need hours a day very close to everything and easy to walk to anything the bellmen help us unload our roofrack and talk to and entertain the boysages and whenever we see them i can not say enough about this hotel esp the staff though it could just be we are good tippers lol i highly recommend to everyone,Positive
my friend and i arrived at the marriott courtyard at east th street friday evening looking forward to our weekend in new york we were not disappointed staff members that we encountered were polite knowledgeable and professional i received a phone call in my room after checking in and the evening before checkout to make sure everything was fine with our room and to see if we needed any services the room was clean the furnishings new and although a little on the cozy side with two full very comfortable beds it was more than adequate given the small amount of time we spent there we were there for a show at town hall so the location was perfect and within walking distance of most of the places we visited this trip our first night we ate at the restaurant salmon river not being gourmands we found the food good they have a very reasonable pretheater dinner menu next door on the other side is charlies cafe open hours i think this hotel is a great value given its location and will definitely stay there my next trip to the city,Positive
my friend and i go to nyc at least once a year and we usually stay at the palace their rates were out of control for this trip feb so i did some hunting and we ended up booking at the courtyard th ave we were so pleased with this hotel its obviously not as posh as the palace but we didnt have one complaint the staff were so helpful and friendly we had a double bed room it was a nice size and the bathroom had plenty of space bath and body works toiletries there are only around or so rooms per floor it was very quiet and not so overwhelming which we had found with hotels like the grand hyatt there is an amazingly clean hr grocery store next door cafe charlie the hotel is less than a block from the nyc public librarybryant park we are picky travelers and have high standards and we would definitely stay here again,Positive
i am currently staying at this hotel while i find an apartment in nyc i moved in here a week ago after a bad experience at a ramada a few blocks southwest of this place i love it here the beds first of all are the most comfy beds ever i also love having full control of the acheater dont assume that all nyc hotels do this i learned the hard way its always as hot or cold as i like it the free internet access is great id rather it be wireless but if i had to choose between wired or sketchy wireless id choose wired so its fine with me the hotel staff is soooo friendly and accomodating everyone greets you with a smile and helps when you need something the hotel itself is very clean and updated i know the curb appeal isnt great with all of the scaffolding but just look beyond that and walk into your own little home in the city my only minor complaint is that room service is too expensive and doesnt really have a great variety of food i know most people eat out when theyre in nyc but im stuck here for two weeks on business and sometimes i just want whats easy plus being in midtown there arent tons of places right next door to eat especially on the weekends but walk a few blocks in any direction and i guarantee youll find something to suit your fancy oh and rays original famous pizza does deliver here and its wonderful the front desk was kind enough to give me menus of a few places theres tons of shopping six blocks south and one block west near macys its easy to walk there and back and times square is an easy walk too the empire state building is very close as well as is grand central terminal which will take you anywhere you want to go all in all i would recommend this place to anyone staying in manhattan it truly has easy access to any place in the city and provides you with the comforts of home you wont regret this one,Positive
i stayed at the courtyard marriott when it was still the clarion th avenue before the renovations but it was a great experience it was my first stay in new york and i was nervous about where we would end up but i didnt need to be the location was perfect we walked to grand central terminal almost every morning in about minutes there was a great place for breakfast fast cheap and good along the way recommended by the concierge frank minutes in the other direction was times square the empire state building was just down the street so was bryant park we were in the middle of everything the staff was friendly and courteous our rooms were very clean and comfortable i thought the lobby was very nice with plenty of room the service was great everyone was very helpful i dont think we could have asked for a better location better service or all in all a better hotel for the price we paid im planning a trip back to new york this time taking my family teenagers and will try to stay at this hotel again,Positive
we stayed here on st patricks day weekend in march the hotel had just undergone a refurb rooms were very clean there was enough room for the of us staff were extremely friendly and helpful hotel is central to all tourist sites and shopping had an excellent break would definately stay in this hotel again its not luxury but then we didnt spend a lot of time in our room as we were shopping all day and taking in the night life at night if you want a cheap but comfy hotel then i would recommend this one,Positive
this hotel was just what we were hoping for friendly staff clean room and great location we will definitely use this hotel again,Positive
this is a fantastic hotel to stay you are in good walking distance to the esb times square central park th ave grand central this is a fantastic locationthe staff were very friendly and couldnt of helped us more the rooms were spotless and comfortablei would definately stay again,Positive
i stayed at the marriott with my sister and mother the hotel is an average one but they employ the nicest friendliest staff i have ever met the rooms were adequate with good sized comfy double beds our room was very clean and was cleaned every day for three women in new york we felt extreemly safe staying herethe best thing about this hotel was definately the staff they were so helpful answering all of the many questions we had even providing bus timetables for an out of town shopping centre with all the relevant information highlightedthe hotel was situated close to the new york library and central to most of the sights we walked everywhere and although it was tiring you see so much more of the cityi would definately go back to this hotel mainly because the staff made us feel so welcome,Positive
the courtyard th ave was absolutely perfect for our night stay great central location we were in nyc for the us open so was in great proximity to grand central station about a min walk being close to grand central was also great for getting to other sights around town as all the trains to wherever we wanted to go left from there also great proximity to time square and empire state builiding it was about a taxi ride to up town or a min walk our room was everything and more than i expected it was just like the pictures on the website the room was all very newly updated and done up the room was modern very functional and housekeepers kept it very clean staff were friendly and helpful there was a great deli right next door and a drug store round the corner we asked for a non smoking twin room on a high floor and all our requests were granted as its just of th ave there was no noise either prices are reasonable by new york standards i found great hotel would definately recommend to those not wanting to splash on hundreds of dollars for a plush hotel or stay in a dodgy rodent infested rundown hotel,Positive
i was very pleased with the rooms which were recently redone i thought it was more upscale than a typical nonurban courtyard the location was good the lobby was being redone but that did not influence my stay in any way the restaurant looked good though we did not get a chance to eat there i would definitely stay there again,Positive
stayed in this hotel for nights in april i checked in at pm and was in my room minutes later my requests from booking were honored without a problem no smokinghigh floor and i was put on the th floor the room was about feet from elevator but there was no noise because there are only rooms per floor i also never waited more than a minute for the elevator at any time of day my northfacing room had a decent view of taller buildings and windows that opened which was great for fresh air and only heard a minimal amount of street noise the room bathroom bedding furniture etc were all clean and new the room was small but very wellappointed throughout the week i was always greeted with a hello and a smile not only from all of the hotels employees but often some of the locals traversing the streetsi did not try the hotels continental breakfast but there is a great new delimarket feet away that has hr salad soup and chinese food bar as well as beer wine soda etc for reasonable prices there is also mulligans pub at th and madison blocks that has good food and drinks times square rock center and empire state building are only minutes by foot for all the tourist traps try the street vendors that line th and th ave eat where the locals are not where the mom and dad with kids and a video camera are the b d f v and subway lines are only a block away at bryant park for quick trips to out of the way eateries grand central terminal is only blocks away and has dozens of great food drink and peoplewatching opportunities also the subway was very safe and clean even at nightmy experience here made for a perfect visit and i am ready to return to this hotel already,Positive
we got a rate of per night including taxes i couldnt find anything with queen beds closer to times square the lobby was small they just basically check you in and check you out but we found the service to be great a concierge intervened when we stepped outside to get a cab and he knew the guy was going to rip us off the room was exceptionally clean and the bedding is the new marriott style that people have been referring to we enjoyed the wireless internet service and the large flat screen tv getting aroundit was an easy walk to times square even with a year old the library and bryant park are within a block and are great places to sit and people watch you can grab a bagel and coffee at the street vendor or a more hearty breakfast sandwich at the affordable cafe charlies next door which stays open all night it is more like a grocery store but has soup salads deli fruit and baked goods we walked to this marriott from penn station with our wheeled luggage and walked by both macys and the empire state building we also walked from rockefeller center back down th avenue to the hotel do yourself a favor and take your best walking or running shoes it is also only a few blocks over to where the subway takes you to the south end of manhatten for the ferry or ground zero it felt like a very safe area right around the entrance,Positive
we reserved two rooms here for three nights on th and th floors one room for set of grandparents and another for other set of grandparents plus two year olds yes smallish lobby etc but extremely clean hallways sheets coverlets bathrooms etc excellent location just around the corner from ny public library great for wayfinding comfortable walk to rockefeller center top of the rock is much better observatory deck than empire state more gets a timed entrance way less crowded deck plus view of empire state building new amsterdam theatre lion king grand central etc cafe charlies is a great breakfast lunch late night snack deli shop two doors down also an emergency mcdonalds is block away i was very happy with night and cannot emphasize cleaness of hotel and generally the area outside the entrance i walked past the other marriotts but not as impressed with location and immediate entrance area i also like the night best western seaport inn with a roof terrace but somewhat remote to midtown activities,Positive
a great location for all sight seeing in under mins walking you can get to empire state building grand central station th ave shops many restaurants time squarehotel is good smallish lobby but rooms are clean on the smallish side for us hotel rooms but for uk travellers they are fine worth trying hotel restaurant food is excellent and good value esp the pretheatre dining menu available until pm nice bar to sit at toobell boys are a bit rude pushing their cabs talking on their phones etc and staff not overly friendly ask for a high up room to avoid some of the street noise nice coffee machine and good size tv no bubble bath incl in room though just shampoooverall a fine choice if you can get a fair price and the location just makes it superb for tourists,Positive
i have stayed at this location twice once in with family and once in on businesspros good price for new york great midtown location marriott quality and service all rooms appear to have been recently remodeled with new marriott look awesome tvs large flat screenscons small rooms lower floors get lots of street noise the lobby has limited storage for luggage so storage is a tough job for the bellman they are usually grumpy about it but they have good reason to be plan a few extra minutes to storeretrieve your luggage,Positive
i booked this hotel at a conference rate of under i wouldnt have thought of this hotel except that it was on the conference list choices and the price was great i was pleasantly surprised the rooms were exceptionally clean the service was very friendly and prompt and the internet service is free its a great hotel for all the basics there is a restaurant attached called salmon river that offers room service its okay for a quick bite or drink but new york has more to offer for foodgreat location walk to penn station grand central shopping galore midtown a hop away also i was put in a handicap room when i checked in i asked for another as the sink was akward and they upgraded me to an extra large king after one nighti would recommend for no frills if you get a decent price and good for business travellers,Positive
i found the price and the location to be ideal for my long weekend within easy walking distance of times square empire state building fifth ave shopping grand central station the rooms have just been remodeled the staff pleasant and the area safe note there are two other marriotts within blocks one of them also called courtyard but probably a bit more expensive,Positive
this property is new to the marriott courtyard chain they have some kinks to iron out it is on th st just off th ave great location and the price of a room reflects that location per night even in ny thats a pretty penny for a room these rooms are not yet updated to marriotts new bedding they are very small dont be fooled by their attempt to make you think that this is a quotboutiquequot hotel its not the rooms are just plain small the service is nothing great either front desk staff was more fairfield level service i had breakfast in the restaurant once service was terrible food was poorly prepared there are much better dining options just around the corner i am a platinum elite with marriott and i stayed for a full week apart from the bottle of water and package of cookies that i got as my quotplatinum giftquot no one in the hotel staff or management acknowledged my stay i get the same gift at the per night courtyards they have elevators for floors sometimes it takes a while so plan accordingly bell service is hit and miss the couple of times i needed them i had to wait so again plan accordingly overall a disappointment i would not go back there for a night new york has lots of other options,Positive
i stayed in this hotel for nights in febuary and found it excellent the staff were more than friendly and the hotel was very clean it is the perfect location for a shopping trip as it is so central to everywhere would highly recommend this hotel even though the rooms are a bit small it more than makes up for it in location,Positive
the location of the hotel was amazing we moved to this hotel from the sheraton on th avenue as friends had paid for that and we couldnt afford it we arrived the day after christmas and although it was checkin time pm no rooms were ready we left out bags and continued on with the day when we arrived later that day we then had to request out bags to be brought up i guess so the porter gets a tipalthough the room was smaller its ny and who stays in the room it was super clean had two double beds and plenty of room for all the shopping we had been doing staff were helpful in organising a car to take us to the airport and pointing out where things werewe paid us a night but since then its changed hands and i think gotten more pricey next time i come to ny id stay here again if the price is right the location is fantastic within walking distence to everything midtown which is basiclly all the famous things you here about its no sheraton but it was great for what we needed,Positive
i stayed at this hotel june please note that renovations started at the hotel on june so much of what im writing may no longer applythis hotel is at a great location th street and th avenue one can walk to broadway theaters moma the empire state building and bryant park with free public wifi is less than two blocks awayit is a typical courtyard so it does not have a real lobby theres no inroom minibar or fitness room and the bar in the restaurant salmon river which i found to be adequate is not open past pm inhotel dining choices are very limited but its midtown just start walking in any direction one will encounter a dozen dining options in less than two blocksthe rooms are small but comfortable and more than enough for one person two people might find the accomodations a little cramped the lone closet was very small and the inroom safe is on the shelf above the clothes rack i had to stretch to reach the safe and im a much shorter person would have to stand on a chair to reach the safecheckin was quick and i was allowed into my room well before the official pm time throughout the stay i found the staff to be friendly and efficient the room was kept spotlessthe real test of any business is how it reacts to problems i had two issues during my stay and both were resolved quickly and professionally a few hours after checking in i could not get my laptop to connect to the free wifi the hotel provides a call to the front desk brought a maintanence man to my room in five minutes when he could not solve the connectivity issue the hotels tech guy promptly came to my room after he too was unable to get my laptop to connect i was moved to another room where my laptop connected immediately the whole incident from my first call to when i was surfing the net in my new room took less than minuteson my third day at the hotel the toilet became clogged i called maintenance and went to dinner when i returned less than an hour later the toilet was running properlyi thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will stay at the courtyard fifth avenue again,Positive
we stayed at the hotel a as part of our month world trip in midjanuaryand stayed for nightsthe hotel itself is quite nice a very nice lobby and the rooms were in excellent condition nicely decorated modern and very clean they are however fairly small but my partner and i had no problems with all our luggage and didnt feel over crowded i had a hockey bag and a very large litre backpack you dont spend alot of time inside your hotel room so who cares if it is a bit on the small side that isunless you have kids with you which i could see being a problemthe location was wonderful a stones throw from grand central and the ny public library our room had a good view of the empire state which at night looks especially impressive located right off madison ave and basically right on th avenue makes it a good hotel if you like doing a bit of shopping we walked basically everywhere we needed to go including the empire state building mins times square less than mins rockafeller centre mins and central park outskirts in mins so you can easily walk everywhere with the exception of most downtown sites ground zero and the statue of liberty brooklyn bridge etc with which you can easily catch the subway from grand central to anywhereso overall we were very happy with our stay at the hotel a the staff were very friendly and helpful and it was perfect for our stayi would stay there again next time im in ny provided the price is right we got a decent special online so ended up paying around can,Positive
stayed for nights in march overall the hotel was clean both in public areas and in the roomsthe staff were generally helpful and efficient we were allowed to check in early and the bell capt was friendly and had good information on local featuresno noise from other rooms but the street outside is a bit of a disturbance in room wireless seemed to work ok too which is always nicethe room was serviced daily although definitely put out the privacy please sign unless you want an early wake up callonly complaint was a porter who was rude and uncommunicative when asking to leave bags for a couple of hours on check out due to a late flight he seemed to be like this with everyonei would stay here again for sure its a great location for reaching most things manhattanadditionally if you want a good breakfast go tomoonstruck on madison madison ave at th stwhich is very close to the hotel and served up some great food,Positive
just back from a night stay in new york citywe stayed in hotel a for the first nights and had already booked a second hotel for the remaining nightswe loved this hotel it was so central and it is only steps away from th avenue we didnt want to move to the second hotel which turned out to be a complete let down and a further avenues away from th avenuethe rooms were small but clean and i have no complaints for this hotelthe staff were very friendly and check in and out was very quickwhen i return to new york i will definitely stay here again,Positive
my husband amp i stayed at hotel a for nights over new year the service was very good amp check in was easy amp quick our room was clean amp the bathroom was spotless the room was of adequate size but considering how much time we spent in it this didnt bother me amp it was bigger than another hotel that we had stayed at on a previous visit the location of the hotel is excellent opposite the public library minutes walk from times square and within walking distance of the empire state building macys grand central station rockefeller center amp of course fifth avenuei would definitely recommend this hotel amp would stay there again in the future,Positive
we have just got back from new york from the holidays and stayed at hotel a the staff is very nice and the room is great my husband and i have been visiting new york at least once a month and we think hotel a is one of the nicer hotels we had stayed in in the past months in the price range the room is small but not tiny and the bathroom is very nice definitely will go back again,Positive
i stayed at the hotel a on about occasions i was apprehensive at first after reading some of the reviews but found my room to be very very nice i think since i arrived late i was upgraded and enjoyed the room very much the front desk staff was great especially when i needed to stay an extra night and didnt have a reservation the previous night i was quoted a price near but the next day when i inquired the front desk person said that they were almost sold out and that i could stay for the same low rate the room is very nice and has all the ammenities that i need the neighborhood is quotdeadquot at night but very good location for business i will stay there again,Positive
i just returned from my long awaited trip to new york our stay at the hotel a formerly clarion was very nice the rooms were small especially for people but we managed the staff was courteous and well informed it was a great location right around the corner from th ave and was within walking distance of grand central station times square and the empire state building i would definitely stay there again,Positive
i stayed in the hotel for one night on business as nyc hotels go this was slightly above average especially for the price i requested and received a high floor room with no problems the room was smaller than i expected about x but the bathroom and the carpets were clean and no defects my air conditioner in my room was not as cool as i would like but i didnt give them the opportunity to fix it as i was not in the room that much so i cant comment on whether they addressed it or not i was surprised and pleased to not be charged a penalty for early checkout when my plans changed for location it is very convenient to midtown blocks times square blocks and herald square blocks so it works well for those traveling for pleasure,Positive
the location of this hotel seemed safe enough i have no complaints about the size of the rooms or the furnishings however service was another storymy check in was slow real slow the gentleman had to ask another clerk questions so my guess is he was new that was fine i waited patiently through my minute check in got my keys and went up to my room so far so goodi then headed out to run down the street to a drugstore when i came back my room key didnt work the same guy made a new key for me i went up to my th floor room and had to come right back down this key didnt work either another key was made as i waited for the elevator i overheard the clerk calling engineering on the radio he had asked engineering in a very unprofessional way to meet me at my room engineering met me there but my key worked this time i left two more times that night each time my key did not work each time i met my friendly engineer at the door who was becoming increasingly unfriendly the last time i saw him he said to me quotwill you be going out anymore tonight i need to get some work donequot geez buddy how about fixing the lock or offering to move me to another room when i checked out the next morning i told the desk clerk about my problems he said quotoh well heres your receipt can i help whos nextquot need i say more,Positive
dont be fooled by the nice lobby the standard rooms are a bit substandard and small the room was musty and the carpet dirty our sheets were not changed the next day but it was in a good location and for you can park in a nearby garage all in all okay but i probably wouldnt stay there again,Positive
its a perfect hotel for us not from usa i meen its right there in the middle of ny its close to every thing the hotel was good nice service and they helpt us with all our questions why not exellent we were in our room and it felt a little small thats about it but again we had great nights there cracy swedish people and our best friend marnie that we love so mutch,Positive
we spent a weekend there in octoberand i was very pleased the hotel staff was very kindthe hotel was clean and had a professional appearance the location was excellentand fairly quiet at night we will definitely stay there again,Positive
this hotel was truely awesome located at eth and fifth ave near bryant park and the new york public library this hotel is in the perfect place if your a sightseeer this would be the perfect place for you times square is only a minute walk away as is rockefeller center and the theatre district isnt any further as well if youre into looking at all the famous buildings in nyc then all you have to do is leave the hotel take a right on th and head to fifth ave and look left right there is the empire state building and if you look straight ahead again youre looking at the new york public library if you dont want to head left on fifth ave to the empire state building then turn right and head down about blocks and you will be at rockefeller center or keep on going on fifth ave and a few blocks later you will be at central park at the hotel a there are so many directions you can go from this hotel if you are in nyc sightseeing now as far as the hotel itself goes this hotel was beyond words the staff was awesome and at no time was i ever disappointed with the service when i placed the quotmaid service pleasequot card on the door the room was cleaned from top to bottom the bathroom floor and counter was marble and was very nice and the bathroom itself was large the room i had was a double and i had plenty of room in the room was tv with cabinetdrawers desk with chair a straight back chair ac and heat end tables for the bed lamps all throughout the room nice carpet and a safe there is nothing at all i could say bad about my stay at hotel a the day i left i called down to the doorman to arrange for a vehicle to take me to the airport they also will arrange any transportation you want from touring the city to whatever else the car arrived early to get me to the airport and along the way we had to stop at the atm they dont take credit cards no big deal though the driver was very nice and polite and even showed me some of the areas outside of manhattan that i otherwise wouldnt see in closing if youre considering the hotel a for your stay in nyc you wont regret it i got very lucky with the rates i paid for my stay compared to the budget hotel i booked weeks earlier i actually only paid more for the nights at hotel a then i would have paid at the budget hotel i booked earlier the desk clerk was shocked when i checked in at the rate i received for my stay for a star hotel my rate was dirt cheap like i said this hotel was totally awesome and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in nyc there is also room service that is awesome although a little expensive but well worth it there are elevators that run fairly quick and there was only time i had to wait for an elevator to arrive at my floor so give this hotel a tryi assure you you will not be disappointed,Positive
i had read some mixed reviews of this hotel before going to new york so i was aprehensive however i was pleasantly suprised the hotel was modern the rooms were well appointed for the price and spacious for nyc the staff was friendly and helpful and the concierge went above and beyond the hotel location was great right across the street from the new york public library and lord and taylor perfect for economical cab travel throughout the city because you are right in the middle on manhattan as a single female travler i felt safe in the areawhich is also a big plus if you are looking for a good value in a great locationhotel a is for you,Positive
the hotel a was pretty clean very convienent and had a professional staff the bathrooms were fairly large for manhattan and pretty modern marble countertops apparantly they are renovating the entire hotel in early so it should be even nicer we did priceline and got it for they will upgrade you to a queen for about i think this hotel is a solid star,Positive
my family stayed at the clarion in august the room was clean and comfortable and the staff at the hotel were very accommodating excellent location and safe walking any time day or evening restaurant on premises was also very good with a good variety on menu,Positive
my boyfriend i stayed at the clarion for two nights for our first visit to new york in july we found a special through travelzoo and only paid about per night although the hotel is a block off th avenue its great location the lobby is clean and the desk attendent was pretty friendly not professional though the rooms were amazingly clean and the bathroom spotless if you dont need room service in the morning put up the quotdo not disturbquot sign because the maid will try to enterfor the price that we paid it was definitely worth it to stay a block off th street close to all the sites the rooms were bigger than average size of most ny hotel rooms that i looked up would stay again for that price,Positive
i was told we would be provided a coffee pot but when we arrived they would only provide one for two rooms so we had to share it they said they will no longer provide them after this that was a hassle but they did try to accomodate us i hope they will reevaluate the coffee pot policy everyone at the desk gave us great service otherwise and our room was clean and nicely furnished very small room but we were comfortable we paid per night from eddie the doorman not exactly the friendliest doorman but he got the job done so we were happy maybe he just had a bad day overall we liked hotel a and will be back if the price is right the price we paid may have been a little high,Positive
i read mixed reviews about this hotel and decided on it for my business trip to nyc i travel every other week and until now have only written a review once before it was for the marriot in maui that was magnificent hotel a on the other hand was horrible the lobby was clean and modern as were the rooms the rooms were small typical for ny i wont hold this against them i was satisfied with my choice the first night however the maid tried to clean the room at am the next morning she knocked and proceeded to open the door i was about to leave but my girlfriend was still sleeping so we asked to please come back when i returned to my room that day at pm the room was still not done the room had been unoccupied for hours plenty of time to clean it when i mentioned this to the front desk they said they would send some one up i returned again to the room after dinner room had been unoccupied for hours and found that no cleaning service had happened the next three days the same exact thing occured service comes at am when my girlfriend is sleeping and i am just leaving and never returns i return to an unclean room each day tell the front desk and nothing is done about itthe restaurant called salmon river was equally pathetic i ordered a salmon burger and took one bite it tasted like canned catfood rolled into a patty i refused to pay for this this is the first time i have ever done this on the last day i checked out and found that they had charged my credit card for the room the room had already been paid for by alaska airlines vacations after i got this fixed we asked to check our bags at the front desk so we could get some food before we had to leave for the airport i was told that the bell boy would be out in a few seconds to take care of it we waited in full view of the person who just told me that for minutes finally the bell boy showed up and just told us to put our bags over in the corner of the lobby not some secured closet with claim tickets just in the lobby we could have done this ourself and had time to get food but now we didntthis place is the worst and the service was nonexistent i hope it goes out of business today,Positive
the clarion hotel was conviniently located near most tourist attractions the front desk staff was cordial but not overly friendly the first day we arrived at am and they were nice enough to have a room available right away which was helpful the room was tiny and we had no coffee maker or fridge as with the other reviews im not sure how thoroughly the room was cleaned but our towels and toiletries were replaced daily it was an ok hotel for the price and locationand if its a good deal i might consider staying there again,Positive
we stayed at the clarion for new year the hotel was excellent the staff were fantastic and so was the location the only down side was the room size although we cannot complain the rooms were clean and a sufficient base for our stay the barrestaurant the salmon river which is part of the hotel was superb excellent food and drink made our stay in new york that extra lttle special,Positive
we recently stayed at the clarion new york city with our teenage daughters and month old son the clarion was a great location to eveythingthe people who work there were very helpful and accomadating we did have a problem when we arrived we booked on the internet and were suppose to get double beds and a crib but whenwe arrived at am midnight we got a double and a single couch sofa bed they assured us they would find us a room in the morning which they did they were out of cribs but did get a roll away for us make sure if you book on the internet you call yourself to confirm what type room accomadations you need we would def go back,Positive
my daughter and i stayed at the clarion hotel in a standard room from july to july the room was clean pleasant and quiet one of the telephones was not working the first day but the engineer came and replaced it within a halfhour housekeeping supplied a toothbrush and extra pillows at our request the staff at the front desk was not overly friendly but they did answer any questions we had we did receive one call from the front desk at am asking if we had left any luggage at the airport we had not our last night we received a phone call and a knock on the door from someone who had been given our room number by mistake that suggested to me that the system for keeping track of guests and room numbers is flawed we did have easy access to public transportation and we felt walk safe walking in the neighborhood there were many places to eat nearby we liked the chef express for a quick breakfast or lunch there is no food available at the hotel after pm except from vending machines i felt that we had a good experience for the price of the room we had a combined airfarehotel room package,Positive
we loved the clarion great staff very friendly the rooms were clean and lovely perfect location close to most of the popular tourist attractions would stay there again,Positive
i stayed here with my wife and kids this past weekthe room was cramped for people but we managedgiven the short periods we spent in therethe staff were pleasant enoughnot excessively rude or overly friendlyas the other reviewers have saidthe hotel is in an excellent location but i was expecting a little more for dollars a night would recommend for location but ill be trying elsewhere the next time i visit manhattan psask for an upper floor roomwe were on the th floor the first night and never got any sleep because of the noise the cooling fans make outsidei asked to be moved and we were given a room on the st floor which was better,Positive
we stayed there from may th to june th i was a bit leery after reading some of the comments we arrived early and was checked in promptly customer service was friendly compared to the service we received in nyc in general the the hotel is small with a very nice lobby it looks very nice from the outsideour room is very small but adequate we got our hotel through priceline so we did not have high expectations based on otherr hotel reveiws our room was by the elevators but due to the size rooms per floor of the hotel most of them were by the elevators we smelled smoke the minute we walked in we did not complain and opened the windows the carpet is soiled furnishing is okay desk nightstands tv armoire iron coffee maker arm chair phones the bedding was not appealing the sheets were not pure white bed skirt had stains on it the blanket has holes and the bedspread looked filty couldnt decide if it was dirty or the colors the bathroom was clean and i liked the shampoo and conditioners marble top countertop hair dryer and the tub was clean it did not look like our floor was mopped at all the entire time we were there i did not think our tub was cleaned the soap wrap and empty shampoo bottle were left in the shower the entire time we were there not sure if they did not clean it or did not want to touch our personal items my hair was left in the tub and soap scum was on shower facet and this indicated to me that they did not clean it new towels were replaced and the sink facet and countertop were cleaned dailyhere is the best part we were there for nights and our sheets were not changed once i put a light pen mark on it and the mark was there every nigth we returned i did that on the fitted sheet so i cannot say about the flat sheet and the pillows we wore our clothes to bed and lined the top of the pillow with our clothes we closed the windows to bed to avoid using the blanket our concern was whether the sheet was changed from the previous occupant we decided not to say anything since we left our worldly possession there and did not want an angry housekeeper to tamper with our stuff we had a good time in the city so i cannot say that it ruined our experience i am not sure that i would stay there again though,Positive
fully enjoyed the week stay the hotel employees were very helpful and friendly the room was very clean and the view was good we were on the th floor and even though looking out there was an office building in front of us but looking to the left you had a pretty good view wasnt disappointed at all only complaint we had was with the restaurant connected to the hotelsalmon run employees short with answers and at times actually rude but with our location in midtown we had a variety of places to dine out would definitely stay here again on next trip to ny,Positive
fantastic hotel great location and good rate paid for this hotel on the corner of th st and fifth ave about blocks to macys and the empire state building and a minute walk to times square or rockefeller center not alot of service but the rooms were good sized for ny very clean and everyone was friendly from the front desk to the concierge to the bell captain would definitely stay here again simply for the location,Positive
the room was small but very clean we stayed on the th floor and the only noise we had was from jack hammers on the street no noise from other tenants staff was very helpful especially haydon our flight didnt leave until lateso when we checked out our luggage was stored at no charge we would stay again,Positive
